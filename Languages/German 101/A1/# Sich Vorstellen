            I have a course from eight to seven, I arrive at there by bus/car
            I go to the course at the weekend (on saturday and sunday)
            I got bored of the school and teachers
            I want to work --> in a factory in my future
                           --> as a music teacher in my future or I want to study at Conservatory. 
                           --> as a lawyer or a psychologist in my future
                           --> as a military engineer in my future
