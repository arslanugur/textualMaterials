My name is İsmail Bayal, 49 years old. I was graduated from the Selçuk University in Konya province in 1995, 
my major(mecır) is clinical medicine. I live in Aksaray from 2007, it’s almost fourteen years. 
I have ever worked in Occupational and Environmental Diseases Hospital in Ankara 
and Niğde Public Hospital for chest diseases service from 2005 to 2007.
And now, I’m working in Aksaray INOVA private hospital in Aksaray in 2020. 
As a doctor, my motto is “The value of human health is priceless.”. 
I spend most of my time to my patients, to help them get out of the pain of disease. 
However, I’ve never forgot to improve myself with professional medical knowledge. 
I started to learn English five years ago. 

And I am also interested in a minor (miynır) in allergies.

Hope I have this honor. At last, I want to say thanks again for giving me this interview chance.

it is much possible to find a job like this
I am happy when my patients get better
I can see with a lot of people due to my job, therefore, I have opportunity to know them

as for the bad side of my job
my job is a little risky
I have a possibility that I may get infected by patients.
Sometimes, Dealing with people can be really difficult to me,
I really feel upset when my patients pass away

while I was working at aksaray public hospital, I had a patient who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also known as shortness of breath
one day she asked me that whether she will live more or not. 
After that, other patient's relative intervented and said that his mom was like her and she lived for just three years.
and this situation made me angry and my patient upset. therefore I wanted him to get out of the room  

when I was six years old. as far as I remembered, I fell into a construction pit. 
my neighbor saw me and then rescued me. I was almost dying there. I can never forget this memory. 
after many years,  I heard that the man who rescued me, had an accident and passed away. 
whenever i remember, It always makes me sad about this occasion.  

My English wasnt good, I have studied English for five years
My english is still partly bad
I have experienced in a private hospital recently, I hadn't any experience before 
I can find time to take care of my children much before
I started spending a lot of time with my family
I have time for english course, gym exercises and walking around
I read business books


I need to improve my medical knowledge/English
I want to express myself in English
