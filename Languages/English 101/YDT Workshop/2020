İmparatorluklarını genişletmek için hem fetihleri ​​hem de barışçıl asimilasyonları kullandılar (16) ---- Kolombiya öncesi Amerika'nın en büyüğü oldu.

30. E

People have often reported seeing animals, inanimate objects, and people who have previously died. 
They may be ‘ghosts’ or ‘angels’ and some involve quite complicated scenes or bizarre situations. 
These are known as hallucinations. Some visual hallucinations are silent, 
  but in some, people speak, often directly to the individual experiencing the hallucination and give them specific commands. 
  But why do hallucinations occur? 
There are a number of psychological explanations for their occurrence. 
Freudians see hallucinations as projections of unconscious wishes or wants.
For example, what a person experiences as “real” in a hallucination is actually something they felt but could not express because it was felt subconsciously. 
Cognitive psychologists point to problems in cognitive processing,
particularly metacognition, which is concerned with the
understanding of others’ behaviours. However, it is the
biological psychologists who focus most clearly on the
causes. They see hallucinations primarily as deficits in
brain states resulting from damage and chemical
imbalances. They have been able to identify the
chemical processes that lead to hallucinations.
Nevertheless, explaining why a particular individual has
a very particular hallucination remains something of a
mystery.According to the passage, biological psychologists
----.see hallucinations as the subconscious of an
individual with hidden wishes and desiresclaim that hallucinations may occur due to some
physical or chemical problems in the brainfocus on seeing some spiritual concepts such as
ghosts and angels resulting in bizarre situationsregard hallucinations as the projections of other
people’s behaviours and their misinterpretationtreat hallucinations by giving specific commands to an
individual experiencing a hallucination

2020-YDT/İNGSweden is Europe’s fifth-largest country, with an area
about the size of California. Roughly 1,600 km lie
between its southernmost and northernmost points.
About 15% of its area lies north of the Arctic Circle,
where, for a few days each summer, the sun never sets,
and never rises for a similar period in winter. The
Swedish climate is not severe, thanks to the warming
influence of the Gulf Stream. Only 7% of Sweden’s area
is cultivated farmland; more than half of the country is
covered by timberlands, consisting mostly of coniferous
forests. Mountains, fells, and wetlands occupy nearly a
quarter of the country. Sweden has about 100,000
lakes, which include Vanern, the third-largest body of
fresh water in Europe. The Swedes are proud of the
natural beauty of their country and this large variety in
landscape makes Sweden a prime travel destination for
outdoor enthusiasts. Norrland, the northern three-fifths
of the country, is rich in natural resources, including
timber, ore deposits, and rivers, whose waterfalls
contribute to the national energy supply. It is here that
the local indigenous people earn their traditional
livelihood herding reindeer.Which of the following statements about Sweden
is true according to the passage?Sweden is five times larger than California.A very small portion of the country is used for
agriculture.Mountains and wetlands constitute a great majority of
the country's surface area.Norrland, the northern three-fifths of the country, is
uninhabited.Coniferous forests cover only a tiny proportion of the
country.

2020-YDT/İNGBritain’s character has been shaped by its geographical
position as an island. Having never been successfully
invaded since 1066, its people have developed their
own distinctive traditions and continue to delight in
their own nonconformity. Britain’s heritage can be seen
in its ancient castles, cathedrals, and stately homes with
their gardens and parklands. It is also evident in the
many age-old customs played out across the nation
throughout the year. For a small island, Britain
encompasses a surprising variety in its regions, whose
inhabitants maintain distinct identities. Scotland and
Wales are separate countries from England with their
own legislative assemblies. They also have their own
surviving Gaelic languages and unique traditions. The
landscape is varied, too, from the mountains of Wales,
Scotland, and the north, through the flat expanses of the
Midlands and eastern England, to the soft, rolling hills of
the south and west. The long, broad beaches of East
Anglia contrast with the rocky inlets along much of the
west coast. Despite the spread of towns and cities over
the last two centuries, rural Britain still flourishes. The
countryside is dotted with farms and charming villages,
with picturesque cottages, and lovingly tended gardens.
The most populated part of the nation is the Southeast,
close to London, where modern office buildings mirror
the growth of the service and high-tech industries.The ancient castles, cathedrals, and stately homes
in Britain are an example of ----.its rich cultural pastBritish disobediencethe conflict between Scotland and WalesBritain’s resistance to invasionsthe architecture still practised today

2020-YDT/İNGInfluenced by the common misconception, films such as
Jurassic Park show dinosaurs with tough, leathery,
rhino-like skin, but it has since been proven that many
dinosaur species were feathered. In a study, a group of
scientists have analysed the fossilised remains of the
bird-sized dinosaur Anchiornis, which lived 160 million
years ago. The specimen has particularly well-preserved
feather details, a feature that is usually lost during
fossilisation. Covering its body, Anchiornis had unusual
contour feathers plumage not used in flight that were
soft and V-shaped, at around one to two centimetres in
length. Longer flight feathers emerged in layers from all
four of the animal’s limbs. Anchiornis seems to have
needed extra flight feathers because theirs were not
zipped together like a bird’s, and so generated less lift.
Fossil feathers in particular are very hard to interpret for
scientists because they are preserved as flat stains
derived from the feather pigments. So, making an
illustration of the dinosaur was very tough, but
the researchers worked closely with a scientific
illustrator and came up with the most accurate depiction
of a dinosaur ever.According to the passage, the skin of dinosaurs ----.is generally believed to lack feathers but, in fact, many
dinosaur species had themwas first discussed by the films like Jurassic Park

2020-YDT/İNGSince the time of Christopher Columbus, Europeans
have called the original inhabitants of North America
“Indians”. Giving them a common name is misleading
since these people had no national identity. They lived
in areas as diverse as the Arctic and the deserts of the
southwest, and differed greatly in their lifestyles. In the
north, the Cree hunted moose and caribou. Tribes such
as the Huron and the Iroquois in the northeast and the
Apache in the southwest were farmers, while those in
the northwest relied on fishing. Before the Europeans
arrived, some tribes of the great central plains cultivated
the fertile lands along rivers and streams, while others
hunted bison during the summer. After European
contact, they took easily to the horses that were brought
and used them to help in their hunting. The huge herds
of bison then became more important to Plains Indians
─ they could eat their meat, make their skins into
clothing and shelters, and use their bones and horns to
make tools. Although they survived attempts by
European settlers to wipe them out, few native
Americans now follow a traditional lifestyle, but most are
very proud of their ancestry.According to the passage, giving a single common
name to all the original inhabitants of North America
was inappropriate because ----.they were quite diverse and were not identified as one
unified entitythey had nomadic lifestyles before settling down in
different placesvery few of them are eager to follow the traditional
lifestyle todayit is still contradictory who the first nation that
appeared in the region wasthey mostly farmed as well as hunting, especially
bison

from a number of land transport inventions, one of
which was the railroad, as it made it possible to travel

2020-YDT/İNGThe learning of culture is an integral part of
language education because culture dramatically
influences how people speak in everyday
interaction.Everyday interaction seems to be affected by culture
to a great extent, which, in turn, affects how culture is
taught in language education.Language education, where the way people of a
certain culture speak in their routine activities
is taught, significantly contributes to the learning of
culture.Culture largely determines the norms of speaking in
everyday interaction, so the learning of culture is
perhaps the most important aspect of language
education.Given that culture substantially affects the way people
speak in daily communication, the learning of culture
cannot be separated from language education.Learning a language means learning the culture of
that language; that is, language education also helps
people speak in a particular language according to
cultural norms.

primary greenhouse gas emitters, they should
play a role in helping the world shift to renewable
energy sources.In order to help the world move to renewable energy
sources, industrialised countries should stop releasing
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.It is the duty of industrialised countries to move to
renewable energy sources as they are the world's
major contributors to the production of greenhouse
gases.Although industrialised countries give out greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere, they need to help the
world to start using renewable energy sources.The reason why industrialised countries should
help the world to turn to renewable energy sources is
that they have been largely responsible for
greenhouse gas emissions.Not only industrialised countries, which release
greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the other
countries of the world also need to shift to renewable
energy sources.

E)Sociology is one of a number of social sciences
which attempt to understand and explain the
behaviour of human beings. Unlike some social
sciences, it does not confine itself to one particular
area of society. ---- It is hard to think of any
significant area of life which has never been the
subject of a sociological study.Indeed, sociologists are concerned with a vast range
of topics including shopping, popular music, poverty,
and migration.In sociology, then, it is essential to understand the
social context in which human behaviour takes place.A change in society such as the introduction of new
technology can lead to new ways of behaving.Socialisation is a lifelong process which continues as
people change their jobs or roles and as society itself
changes.At the most basic level, sociology involves
understanding the culture of the society in which social
action occurs.

2020-YDT/İNGMicrowave ovens do not directly cook food; what
they do is heat water. The frequency of microwaves
happens to be just right for exciting water
molecules. ---- Nearly all food contains water, but
microwaves will not cook completely dry food like
cornflakes, rice or pasta.Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation
that sits on the spectrum between radio waves and
infrared light.By spreading their energy evenly through food, the
microwaves heat the water in it and the hot water
cooks the food.Microwave cookery is similar to heating food in a
normal oven, except that the microwaves penetrate
deeper and more quickly.The molecules in the centre of your soup are not
heated any quicker than those on the outside.Exciting the water molecules means that the food
rarely gets much hotter than 100°C, at which water
boils.

of soil bacteria, but a team of scientists recently
took the first steps toward creating one and found
out something surprising along the way. These
researchers collected nearly 300 soil samples from
18 countries and as many different environments as
possible. ---- However, the scientists found that
across these different environments on Earth, a
relatively small number of bacteria species
dominated.These tiny organisms, which populate every
environment, play active roles in many of Earth’s
biological processes.They create acidic environments, decompose dead
organisms and release gases.They were expecting to find a diverse array of bacteria
species spanning different terrains.With this new bacteria list, scientists have a starting
point for studying the complex web of ecosystem.Of the thousands of individual species of bacteria, only
20 percent of those are known to scientists.

2020-YDT/İNGThe carbon cycle is the natural system that, ideally,
creates a balance between carbon emitters (such as
humans) and carbon absorbers (such as trees) so
that the atmosphere does not contain an increasing
amount of carbon dioxide. It is a huge process that
involves oceans, land, and air. ---- You can think of it
almost as the Earth breathing in and out.The exchange of carbon dioxide between the ocean
and the air happens at the surface of the water.The seas’ ability to absorb carbon dioxide has long
been known to scientists.The carbon cycle is called “in balance” when roughly
the same amount of carbon that is being pumped into
the air is being sucked out by something else.Given the important role that carbon dioxide plays in
warming the Earth, you may be surprised by how little
of it is in the atmosphere.Carbon dioxide is composed of one carbon atom and
two oxygen atoms, connected by double bonds.

E)The creation of revolutionary products or practices
has no timetable. Great minds give birth to
innovations as inspiration hits, necessity requires,
or happenstance would have it. ---- The
Renaissance, for instance, was a period of great
intellectual exploration, an era of innovation in
arts, philosophy, medicine, engineering, and
science. Inventions of the Renaissance include the
printing press and movable type. It was also at this
time that Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) drew the
first plans for a flying machine, a precursor to
planes and jets that would be devised and
developed centuries later.Human progress is now taking place at an
unprecedented pace.Nevertheless, the history of the human race can
conceivably be called the story of innovation.However, there have been a number of specifically
fruitful periods of invention throughout history.Also, their other inventions go beyond basic human
needs to enhance human interaction.Furthermore, the invention of the electric bulb is said
to be a pure coincidence.

E)(I) Carbohydrates are a vast and diverse group of
nutrients found in most foods. (II) This group includes
simple sugars and complex forms such as starches,
which are broken down during digestion to produce
simple sugars. (III) In contrast to the other
carbohydrates, fibre is a type of complex carbohydrate
that cannot be readily digested by our bodies. (IV) The
main function of the simple sugars and starches in the
foods we eat is to deliver calories for energy. (V) The
simple sugar glucose is required to satisfy the energy
needs of the brain, whereas our muscles use glucose
for short-term bouts of activity.IIIIIIIVV(I) Water is of such great importance that it makes up
almost two thirds of the human body by weight. (II) It
plays a fundamental role in digestion and absorption
and in the elimination of indigestible metabolic waste.
(III) Water for the body is obtained primarily by drinking
and ingesting food as well as through internal chemical
reactions. (IV) Water also serves as the basis of the
circulatory system, which uses blood to distribute
nutrients to the entire body. (V) Moreover, water helps
maintain body temperature by expelling excess heat
through the skin via sweat and evaporation.IIIIIIIVV

2020-YDT/İNG(I) Creativity tests, mostly devised over the last
thirty years, are aimed at assessing the qualities and
abilities that constitute creativity. (II) These tests
evaluate mental abilities in ways that are different from
─ and even diametrically opposed to ─ conventional
intelligence tests. (III) Because the kinds of abilities
measured by creativity tests differ from those measured
by intelligence quotient (IQ) tests, persons with the
highest scores on creativity tests do not necessarily
have the highest IQs. (IV) Most creativity tests in use
today are based at least partially on the theory of
creativity evolved by J.P. Guilford in the 1950s.
(V) Creative people tend to have IQs that are at least
average if not above average, but beyond a score of
120 there is little correlation between performance on
intelligence and creativity tests.IIIIIIIVV(I) The Industrial Revolution brought great wealth to
factory owners and made basic goods such as food and
clothing cheaper than ever before. (II) During the
Industrial Revolution, a great majority of workers in
factories were children; as a result, accidents were very
common. (III) However, the Industrial Revolution also
created a new kind of poverty. (IV) Large numbers of
people moved to the cities in search of work, where they
were packed into crowded, dirty housing. (V) Many were
unemployed and ended up in prison for debt, or forced
to move into harsh lodgings called workhouses, where
they performed hard labour for low wages.IIIIIIIVV




A) B) C) D) E)(I) Since their earliest presence on Earth, humans
have sought to make sense of their surroundings.
(II) Survival depended on understanding the behaviour
of a volcano, the flood cycles of a river, or the optimum
time to cross a mountain pass. (III) Humans developed
ways to record and pass on such information.
(IV) Modern science and information gathering have
given anthropologists more insight than ever
before. (V) As they ventured from their places of origin,
by land and by sea, people acquired a broader
perspective of Earth's processes and of the patterns and
impact of human settlement throughout the world.IIIIIIIVV
