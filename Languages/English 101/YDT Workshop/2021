2021-YDT/İNGIn 1911, the Mona Lisa painting in the Louvre Museum
came to global stardom when she became the victim of
one the most recognised art thefts in history. For two
years the whereabouts of the painting by the great
Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci remained a mystery.
Then in November 1913, the thief named Vincenzo
Peruggia contacted an art dealer in Italy and offered to
bring him the painting for a reward of 500,000 lire.
Peruggia had moved to Paris in 1908 and had worked at
the Louvre for some time. Dressed in a white smock
worn by Louvre employees, he had hidden inside the
gallery until it closed for the night. He then removed the
painting from its frame and strolled out with it hidden
under his smock when the museum opened as usual
the following morning. The theft was genius in its
simplicity – Peruggia, in his work clothes, had attracted
no notice and had been out of the area by the time the
theft was realised. He was arrested, but unfortunately
served only eight months in prison thanks to a
psychiatrist who testified that he was ‘intellectually
deficient’.The underlined word ‘stardom’ in the passage is

2021-YDT/İNGSocial media websites arrived in the middle of a
dramatic increase in the quantity and intensity of human
loneliness, a rise that initially made these websites’
promise of greater connection seem deeply attractive.
A recent study found a complex relationship between
loneliness and social networking. Social media users
had slightly lower levels of social loneliness (the sense
of not feeling bonded with friends), but significantly
higher levels of family loneliness (the sense of not
feeling bonded with the family). It may be that social
networking encourages more contact with people
outside of our household, at the expense of our family
relationships or it may be that people who have
unhappy family relationships in the first place seek
companionship through other means, including social
media websites. The fears that social media is
distancing us from each other, making us lonelier; and
that social networking might be spreading the very
isolation it seemed designed to conquer highlight the
anxieties that social media have produced. In fact, what
social media has revealed about human nature is that a
connection is not the same thing as a bond, and that
instant and total connection is not a ticket to a happier,
better world.According to the passage, why did social media
become so attractive?It connected people from different backgrounds to
improve their social experiences.It enabled family members to strengthen their bonds
with each other.It spread happiness by giving people the opportunity to
make new social contacts.It offered greater connection at a time when people
were feeling extremely lonely.It gave self-confidence to introverts by encouraging
them to contact new people.

2021-YDT/İNGAround 1650 BCE, central Anatolia’s city-states were
united by conquest into a kingdom with its capital at
Hattusa. Vigorous rulers of this Hittite Old Kingdom
campaigned into Syria and even sacked Babylon in
1595 BCE. However, the series of succession disputes
that followed reduced their dominions. From the 14th
century BCE on, strong Hittite kings regained previously
lost territories, expanded into western Anatolia, and
destroyed the Mitanni Empire in Syria, thus bringing
them into direct territorial competition with the
Egyptians. After the inconclusive Battle of Qadesh
around 1274 BCE, Egypt accepted Hittite control over
Syria. Widespread human and natural troubles in the
eastern Mediterranean around 1200 BCE destroyed the
Hittite Empire, but a number of small Neo-Hittite
kingdoms sprang up in southern Anatolia and Syria,
prospering until the Assyrians conquered them in 700
BCE. Barbarian raiders ever present to their north and a
tradition of armed conflict made the Hittites invest
heavily in defence. Massive and complex city
fortifications included towers, huge stone gateways with
difficult approaches, and long tunnels under the walls to
secret exits. Often a citadel and inner defensive walls
protected the palace and other key buildings.The rivalry between the Hittites and Egyptians
started as a result of ----.the unification of Anatolian city-states against the
Hittitesa number of succession disputes among the Hittitesthe loss of some Hittite territories in western Anatoliathe destruction of the Mitanni Empire by the Hittitespoor administration by Hittite rulers

2021-YDT/İNGUnder the Roman Republic, brickmaking, particularly
in the region of Rome itself, became a major industry,
and finally, under the Empire, it became a state
monopoly. Brick construction was cheaper than stone
due to the economies of scale in mass production and
the lower level of skill needed to put it in place. The
brick arch was adopted to span openings in walls.
Mortar had traditionally been composed of sand, lime,
and water, but beginning in the 2nd century BCE, a new
ingredient was introduced. The Romans called it pulvis
puteoli after the town of Puteoli (modern Pozzuoli), near
Naples, where it was first found. The material, formed in
Mount Vesuvius and mined on its slopes, is now called
pozzolana. When mixed with lime, pozzolana forms a
natural cement that is much stronger and more
weather-resistant than lime mortar alone, and that will
harden even underwater. Pozzolanic mortars were so
strong and cheap, and could be placed by labourers of
such low skill, that the Romans began to substitute them
for traditional mortars inside walls. The concrete made
from pozzolana made it possible to create curved
shapes and led to the creation of a series of remarkable
interior spaces spanned by domes and columns.Which of the following was one of the advantages of
brick over stone?It was more practical to use in construction than stone.It was unique to Rome, which made brickmaking a
state monopoly.It created a new type of job, which revived the
economy.It was easier to use given that Rome did not have
enough labour force.It required a high level of skill, which improved
construction.

2021-YDT/İNGThe skill of observing animals to aid our survival dates
back millennia. Nearly 6,000 years ago, indigenous
people of North America used their deep understanding
of bison behaviour to devise an efficient way to hunt. In
modern times, our interest in animal behaviour comes
with new insights and terminology. ‘Herd sourcing’, for
example, borrows from the word: ‘crowdsourcing’, but
centres on using the collective intelligence of wildlife
rather than people. Over the last few years, watching
animals for the clues they provide about the natural
world has shifted from folklore to science. In 2013, for
example, US scientists put to the test the ‘old wives’
tale’ that cows lie down when rain is on its way. The
researchers measured the core body temperature of
cattle and found that cows lie down when it is cold and
stand up when it is hot to disperse heat. While it may
not accurately predict precipitation, it does show a link
between cattle behaviour and the weather.It is pointed out in the passage that observing
animals ----.is not a recent trendmostly benefitted indigenous peoplehas shaped people’s ideas about the worldwas more popular in hunting communitiescan harm their environment

impossible to predict natural disasters like
earthquakes.The idea that animals can predict natural disasters
isn’t actually a new one. 3,000 years ago Chinese
scholars were convinced that they could.I think scientists will have a better understanding of
whether animals can in anyway feel a natural disaster
with more evidence.Researchers who studied the Etna volcanic eruption
and following earthquakes observed that animals
reacted during the hours before.When a natural disaster like a volcanic eruption is
underway, the ground under us changes. So, we might
be feeling those.

to keep their body at roughly the same temperature
no matter what the surrounding temperature is.The surrounding temperature does not prevent
mammals from maintaining their body temperature at
more or less the same level if they are warm-blooded.Even if the outside temperature changes slightly, it
does not affect mammals’ ability to keep their body at
approximately the same temperature because they are
warm-blooded.Irrespective of the surrounding temperature,
warm-blooded mammals will continue to maintain their
body temperature at a constant level.If mammals were not warm-blooded, they would not
keep their body temperature at exactly the same level
despite the changes in the surrounding temperature.Regardless of the surrounding temperature, mammals
manage to maintain their body at approximately the
same temperature since they are warm-blooded.

2021-YDT/İNGConsidering both numbers of animals involved and
the extent to which they are harmed, factory farming
causes more harm to animals than does any other
human practice.Other human practices are more harmful to animals
than factory farming when both numbers of animals
and how much they are damaged are taken into
consideration.Not only factory farming but also other human
practices have caused considerable harm to animals,
resulting in an increase in the number of animals
being damaged.The number of animals suffering from the harmful
effects of factory farming has increased, making
factory farming the most dangerous human practice to
affect animals.Factory farming, which causes more animals to
suffer from its negative effects, is one of the main
contributors to the damage to animals along with other
human practices.Factory farming is more harmful to animals compared
to other human practices when numbers of animals as
well as the degree of the damage are taken into
account.Before the 17th century, no serious scientific work

that gases were all just air.By the 17th century, none of the scientific studies done
on gases could eradicate the thought that gases are

continue ignoring me?I think the new neighbours and I have a small problem.
Maybe you would be able to help us sort it all out.It is your little daughter’s first day at school.
However, she is very nervous about making new
friends. You want to show that you understand her
and also you want her to socialise and have fun. So
you say to encourage her: ----I know it is sometimes difficult to make new friends at
school, but can’t you at least try it for me?While I was a student, I always had lots of friends and
we would enjoy ourselves a lot! I still see some of
them.Why don’t you just relax? If you don’t like them, you
don’t have to talk to them!I know how you feel, but when you have friends
around you, you can do many enjoyable activities!Never mind! You are such a lovely girl, you don’t need
many friends.

E)You had to hand in an assignment on Monday, but
you were ill over the weekend and so you ask for a
one-day extension. Your teacher asks why you are
requesting extra time. You want to respond politely,
so you say: ----Here’s the doctor’s note. If you read it, you’ll know
why.I’m really very sorry. I was quite ill over the weekend.Yes, I should have handed in the assignment
yesterday.I was really ill. Can’t you tell by the way I look today?I think you’re one of the best teachers at our school.You have just started working at a small successful
company. One day, your brother calls and asks you
to buy him a new mobile. However, with utilities,
rent, and other expenses, you are on a strict budget.
So you have to decline for now: ----I’m sorry but money is a bit tight at the moment. I
promise I’ll get you one as soon as things start to look
up.It all depends on the model you want. I won’t get you
an expensive one if you’re just going to change it in a
couple of months.Since we live together and share the expenses, you
should be aware that we can’t afford a new mobile
now.If you cannot bear the expense of a new mobile
yourself, I suggest you work harder and get a
high-paying job like mine.I don’t have much money right now, but I’ll call our
parents and ask them to buy you a new mobile.

2021-YDT/İNGYour friend has recently started painting. Although
she is not really good at it, she is overly confident
about her work. She shows you one of her paintings
and asks your opinion so you say making fun of
her: ----It would be considered a masterpiece if you were a
three-year-old kindergarten student.I’m really happy for you. You’ve found a hobby that
you’re happy with.This is garbage. You’ve been taking lessons for a
month and this is all you can do?I think you need to take more lessons to be a good
painter.Even if you've just started, you did good enough. It's

E)The Aral Sea is a saltwater body in central Asia. It is
bordered by Kazakhstan in the north and Uzbekistan
in the south. The Aral Sea once covered an area of
68,000 square kilometres. However, it started to
shrink during the second half of the 1900s, as most
of the inflowing river water was used for irrigation
before it reached the sea. The sea also loses water
through evaporation. ---- The Aral has therefore
shrunk drastically in its area and volume. By the end
of the 1900s, the Aral Sea had lost so much water
that the exposed land divided the sea into three
separate parts.The Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers, which are
mainly used for irrigation, are the sea's two main
sources of inflowing water.The fishing industry along the Aral Sea has also been
virtually destroyed due to a number of factors.Also called Lake Aral, the Aral Sea is situated more
than 400 kilometres east of the Caspian Sea.Scientists view the changes to the Aral Sea as a
serious threat to the local environment and human
health.Because there is not much rainfall, this water is not
replaced fast enough to maintain the water level.

2021-YDT/İNGSeveral studies have shown that dancing can help
to increase feelings of self-worth. In one 2007 study,
researchers found that children aged between 11
and 14 who took part in creative movement classes
reported improved self-esteem, motivation, and
more positive attitudes towards dance, as well as
better physical fitness. Dancing has also been
shown to reduce feelings of depression. ---- In a
study, dancing characterised by relaxed,
free-flowing movements helped to improve mood,
whereas dancing in a physically contracted way had
the opposite effect.However, different dancing styles have had different
effects on people.In fact, people are communicating with potential
mates when they dance.Just five minutes of freestyle dancing can increase
creativity.Therefore, dancers show improvements both in mood
and problem-solving.In addition, group dancing can increase a person’s
threshold for pain.

E)Technology is a powerful component of the modern
world. Without technology, many of the most
significant feats of the 20th century could not have
been achieved, such as sending people to the Moon,
erecting skyscrapers, damming enormous rivers,
and communicating with friends around the
world. ---- We use technology to house, clothe, feed,
entertain, and transport ourselves. It is a crucial
component of our work, play, education, shopping,
and travel.Our decisions about how to develop technology, and
when and where to use it, can make a great difference
for future economic, political, and social well-being.Not only does technology shape our tools, devices,
buildings, and cars, but it also affects our values,
ideas, and beliefs.However, it is essential for all of us to realise that
technology can have destructive consequences when
misused.Though less often recognised, the most significant
power of technology is its assistance in so many
aspects of our everyday lives.In order to direct technology in the most beneficial
ways, we need to know more than science and
engineering traditionally offer.

2021-YDT/İNGThe line that separates one country from another is
called a border. Sometimes these follow a natural
feature, such as a mountain range or a river. On
other occasions they follow a straight line, ignoring
physical features. ---- However, if there is a
conflict, borders may be heavily guarded, and it is
often difficult to move from one country to another.The longest undefended border in the world runs
between the US and Canada.Politics can play an important role in the creation of
borders, for example when one country seeks
independence from another.When countries are on friendly terms, borders can be
little more than lines on a map, easily crossed.Generally you can only cross the borders between
countries if you have either a passport or the
appropriate paperwork.While some countries, like Greenland, do not have
borders, other countries, like Switzerland, are
surrounded by them.The relationship between humans and dogs has
been in existence for over 10,000 years, and shows
no signs of weakening. But it is changing, as the
traditional tasks that dogs perform have been
supplemented by new roles. There is evidence that
some children with autism-spectrum disorders
benefit from the company of a dog. Some such
children form intense relationships with animals,
seemingly finding them easier to relate to. ----
Otherwise, children tend to ignore pets that were
there when they were babies.However, in order to be the most effective, the dog
has to be obtained when the child is old enough to
interact with it.Getting a dog may not automatically make children
healthier, but you need to train it well for that.In fact, dogs need to be able to read a child’s body
language in order to get the best out of their interactive
natures.That’s why the capacity of pets to bring people
together is made use of in many kinds of therapy.It is not known precisely how this occurs, but a dog’s
ability to detect minute changes in the child’s body
must play a part.

2021-YDT/İNG(I) Creativity usually means producing things that are
both novel and useful but could we design machines
that are creative? (II) Equally controversial is the idea
that one might produce socially and emotionally
intelligent machines. (III) To fully qualify for this praise, a
machine must be able to first read or detect emotions in
another person or machine and then reach out to that
person or machine appropriately. (IV) Many people have
dreamed of a machine that can produce typed script of
what they say. (V) An emotionally intelligent, socially
skilled machine would need to be more than simply
polite but also rewarding and sensitive.IIIIIIIVV(I) Although few facts about his life are known,
al-Farabi's influence on Arabic thought has been widely
accepted. (II) Most of his written commentaries
concerned the writings of Aristotle and, to a lesser
degree, Plato. (III) Al-Farabi is considered the foremost
music scholar in history. (IV) His own philosophy was a
version of Neoplatonism, which he presented in such
works as Tahsil al-Sa'adah (The Attainment of
Happiness). (V) In al-Farabi's view, the world flows from
God in the form of ideas or 'intelligences', from which
levels of existence flow until the material world is
created.IIIIIIIVV(I) The history of human health is the history of
medicine. (II) Accordingly, humans have always used
plants as the centrepiece of our healthcare, but we have
lapsed over the past 50 years. (III) We used to eat more
than 200 types of foods from plants, and now 80 percent
of our diet comes from just 10 species. (IV) The reasons
for this are many, including the prevalence of fast foods
which put convenience over health. (V) The fast food
industry is one of the greatest success stories of all
time.IIIIIIIVV

of the most influential music in history. (II) In 1787 he
studied briefly with the great composer Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart in Vienna. (III) He transformed many
traditional forms of Western classical music. (IV) For
example, he set new standards for the symphony,
creating longer pieces that expressed important ideas
and deep feelings rather than just serving as
entertainment. (V) His works include nine symphonies,
one opera, and many pieces for small groups and for
piano and other solo instruments.IIIIIIIVV(I) Sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface goes through air
molecules and water droplets in the atmosphere,
causing the light to scatter in all directions. (II) The
amount of scattering, just like the reflection of light,
depends on the wavelength of light. (III) For example,
violet light is scattered 16 times more than red light.
(IV) The sky appears blue, and not violet, because the
eye is more sensitive to blue. (V) The shorter
wavelengths are scattered more strongly in all
directions, so that more light of this portion of the
spectrum is seen by the naked eye.IIIIIIIVV
