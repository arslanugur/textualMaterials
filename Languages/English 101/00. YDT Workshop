Consumers purchase products and services to experience certain emotional states or achieve emotional goals in a process called emotional arousal.
Emotions can create a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction, but they can also give the consumer the perception that their purchase will help them avoid a feeling of displeasure. 
No matter what the purchase is, consumers must somehow associate a positive emotional connection between a product and themselves. 
Positive emotions can include the fulfillment of a desire or the feelings of safety and protection.
Consumers also have both unexpressed and expressed emotions. 
It is important to understand the difference between these emotions because if a consumer is purchasing but is not expressing any emotion toward a product, you may need to ask more questions in order to reach the customer on a deeper level. 
Doing so helps the consumers feel that they are somehow linked to your product and that it produces a favorable image of them. 
This reaction evokes consumer identification with your product and motivates them to buy – and keep buying – your product.

    state - durum
    arousal - uyarılma

How does buying something affect consumers’ emotions?
    It gives consumers a feeling of achievement.
    It causes consumers to have damaging thoughts.
    It influences every decision consumers make before purchasing.                                        influence - etkilemek
    It leads to a condition of discomfort and misery.                                                     discomfort - rahatsızlık        misery - sefalet, ızdırap
    It results in a feeling of regret for purchasing too much.                                            result - sonuçlandırılmak

30.  
It is important to comprehend the difference between unexpressed and expressed emotions because ----.     express - ifade etmek
    emotions are important in understanding why consumers buy certain products
    these expressions are evidence of how consumers can reach emotional goals                             evidence - kanıt
    when consumers identify themselves with a particular product, they keep buying it                     identify - tanımlamak
    consumers need to get rid of any uncomfortable and unsafe feelings                                    get rid of - kurtulmak              unsafe - güvensiz

Which of the following could be the main idea of this passage?
    It is important to evaluate the emotional needs of customers.                                         evaluate - değerlendirmek
    Consumers satisfy all of their needs by purchasing products.
    The motivational process begins with the need for a certain product.
    Consumers are triggered by some specific emotions when buying a product.                              specific - özel, belli

A new helmet display promises to give bikers eyes in the back of their heads. 
The designer of the equipment states that the inherent problem with motorcycles is that the mirrors reflect a very small image and, because of the position of the mirrors, motorcyclists mostly just see their elbows. 
A small backlit display screen is added onto motorcycle helmets with an adjustable arm which lets riders place it just below or above their eye, in their peripheral vision. 
A rear-facing camera attached to the back of the bike streams live video via Wi-Fi to the helmet-mounted receiver. 
The images are processed and stabilised before they reach the display to accommodate for the bike’s movements. 
One glance at the display gives the rider a wide view of the road behind them. 
Although the screen is just next to the user’s face, optics fool the eye into focusing at a more comfortable distance of around 3 metres. 
However, it is still suggested that users should check their mirrors and do the lifesaver check, turning their heads to check blind spots.

What is the problem regarding the motorcyclists’ vision?
It is difficult for bikers to get a broad view of the road behind them using only their mirrors.
Fatal accidents cannot be prevented because of the limited use of mirrors.
Motorcyclists have difficulty adjusting mirrors to get images from the sides of the bike.
The body’s position on the motorcycle does not allow the biker to see what is happening around him.
Mirror positions constantly need to be changed to follow traffic flow.

It is understood from the passage that the helmet display ----.
    records the motorcycle’s movements
    is placed directly below or above the mirror on the front of the bike
    views peripheral images and movements, though there is a delay in transmission
    shows images of what is happening behind the motorcycle
    fools motorcyclists’ eyes into thinking things are more than 3 metres behind them

Which of the following could be the best title for the passage?
  New Helmet Technology for Rear Vision
  Helmet Displays Replace Mirrors
  Image Processing through Helmet Displays
  Mirrors versus Helmet Displays
  Lifesaver Check of a Motorcyclist

Today’s symphony orchestra has its roots in 17th
century bands. The earliest orchestras, usually attached
to a church, or a theatre, varied in structure from place
to place. They were often directed from the keyboard or
by the principal violinist. During the 18th century, as
popular works such as those by Haydn and Mozart
began to be played all over Europe, some
standardization of the orchestra became necessary. A
string section comprising violins, violas, cellos, and
double basses was usually joined by two horns, two
flutes, two trumpets, and timpani. The clarinet became a
standard member of the orchestra only at the end of the
18th century. The 19th century saw the rise of public
concerts in large halls, which necessitated louder
instruments and larger orchestras. As a result,
instruments changed. They were redesigned and
adapted to enable them to project further. Larger and
smaller versions of some instruments, such as the
piccolo, cor anglais, and bass clarinet, were featured
more frequently. Some new instruments were also
added, with trombones and later, tubas becoming
standard members of the orchestra.According to the passage, the first orchestras ----.did not all have a consistent structurewere able to perform only in churches and theatreshad almost the same structural system with each otherused the same instruments as modern orchestras do

For centuries, the world’s physicists, writers and
philosophers have argued about whether time travel is
possible, with most coming to the conclusion that it is
never going to happen. But on a large plot of land just
outside the small town of Comfort, Texas, a group of
architects, engineers and scientists are building a
‘Timeship’ that they say it could transport tens of
thousands of individuals to a far-distant future. Their
approach does not involve the use of flux capacitors, or
zooming at light-speed through black holes. Instead, the
Timeship aims to store people at such low temperatures
that their bodies are preserved for a future civilisation to
reanimate them, a concept known as cryonics. “Just as
a spaceship allows people to move through space, our
Timeship will allow people to travel to another time in
the future,” explains Stephen Valentine, who is the
director and principal architect of the Timeship project.According to the group of architects, engineers and
scientists in Texas, ----.the city is not really suitable for the ‘Timeship’ because
it is such a small placeit will soon be possible to transport more than
10,000 people to a far-distant futureit is possible that the bodies of people are preserved

It was a road that kicked off the pattern of destruction in
the Amazon forest. During the 1970s, Brazil began
building the Trans-Amazonian Highway from near the
country’s easternmost point to its western border, where
the state of Amazonas meets Peru. The route opened
up the heart of the Amazon to settlement, causing
deforestation rates to increase. During the 1990s and
early 2000s, more than 25,000 square kilometres of
rainforest per year were cleared out. Throughout these
years, roads have provided the means to penetrate the
forest and eliminate large chunks of it. In an
unpublished study of the Brazilian Amazon, researcher
Christopher Barber found that 95% of deforestation in
the region occurs within 7 kilometres of a road. Once
construction begins, road crews are quickly followed by
land speculators, loggers, farmers, ranchers, gold
miners and others who carve away the forest along the
route. This creates great treeless expanses in the
landscape, but research is now showing that the
building of roads also triggers environmental changes in
the remaining forest that can dry out trees, set the stage
for wildfires, and weaken the ecosystem.Which of the following can be said about the
Amazon forest?The state of Brazil had to build roads through it for the
people who were settled in the forest.Although it damaged the forest, the new highway
enabled the people of Amazonas to better travel
to Peru.From the 1990s onwards, 25,000 square kilometres
were being cut down every year to make way for the
new highway.The rainforest has been suffering from a pattern of
destruction in a scale it had not experienced before
the 1970s.Deforestation has not only affected Brazil’s eastern
and western borders, but it has also started to spread
through other countries.

E)Which of the following best describes the
relationship between road construction and
deforestation?Since the road crews work with a lot of parties to carve
away the forest, deforestation along the route is not
affected at all.According to research on the Brazilian Amazon, a very
large percentage of deforestation is a direct
consequence of building the Trans-Amazonian
Highway.The highway and its branching roads were built to
provide the necessary means of penetrating the forest
to erase the traces of deforestation.Contrary to previous beliefs, research is now showing
that road crews also set fires and dry out the trees
during construction work.Although trees were cut down for the highway resulting
in treeless landscapes, this was limited to an area of
within 7 kilometres of a road.One can conclude from the passage that the author
mainly ----.wants to warn the Brazillian state against the future
consequences of their project of Trans-Amazonian
Highwaytries to point that the environmental effects of building
roads are confused with the ones caused by humansinforms the reader on the effects building a road

measurable experiments marked him as one of the
founders of modern science?He did but it’s unfortunate that his conflict with the
Church led to the censorship of his publications.I know all about this, but I just can’t understand why so

Journalist:
 Experts warn that food industries are being
threatened by a growing resistance to antibiotics.
Researcher:
 Yes, it's becoming more serious day by day. A UK
government report states that by 2050,
antimicrobial resistance will cost more money
than the current size of the world's economy,
leading to catastrophes in food production.

Researcher:
 For example, if you buy a farmed salmon today,
chances are it will have eaten a greater weight of
antibiotics during its life than its own body
weight.
Journalist:
 So, we can say that farming practices are perfect
for boosting antimicrobial resistance.We know that farmers rely heavily on antibiotics.
What is the reason behind their practices?What can health scientists and clinicians do to sort out
the problem?Can you tell us how antimicrobial resistance affects
food?Do you think food industries could collapse if
resistance spreads?What else does the report warn us about?

E)The word ‘fossil’ comes from the Latin word fossilis,
meaning ‘dug up’, and that is how some fossils
are discovered, although most are exposed by
erosion.Despite the fact that the word ‘fossil’ is derived from
the Latin fossilis, which has the meaning ‘dug up’,
not all fossils are discovered that way as they mostly
appear due to erosion.The word ‘fossil’ which originated from the Latin word
fossilis, means ‘dug up’ but the way that most of them
are discovered is through their appearance after
erosion.Unlike the ones that are discovered after appearing
due to erosion, ‘fossils’ are ‘dug up’, as the meaning of
the Latin word fossilis suggests.The word ‘fossil’ is derived from the Latin word fossilis
and it means being ‘dug up’ instead of being
discovered after having emerged due to erosion.Fossilis, which is the Latin origin of the word ‘fossil’,
means discovered either when it is ‘dug up’ or
emerged as a result of erosion.

People get more knowledgable and develop new skills more rapidly in infancy than they do in childhood, when they grow up slowly.
The pace at which people acquire new abilities and knowledge, and grow up is more gradual in childhood than in infancy.

You and a friend are supposed to meet for dinner at a restaurant. Your friend arrives twenty minutes late
and says it was because of the traffic, which is normal in your city. 
Frustrated, you want to criticise your friend for being late, so you say: ----I know. 
The traffic is always terrible around here, especially this time of day.
If you had planned ahead and left home earlier you wouldn’t have been late.
Next time why don’t you consider taking the metro? 
It isn’t affected by the traffic.
I really wish more could be done to deal with the traffic problem in our city.
It’s okay. The food here is usually not served in a timely manner, anyway.

You and your friends went out for dinner. 
Your friends all found their meals delicious but you were dissatisfied with yours. 
You disagree with them about the quality of the food, so you say politely: ----The food was terrible. 
I’m going to write a very negative review for this restaurant.
This restaurant is very disappointing, especially the old decor and slow service.
I’m glad you all enjoyed your meals, but I must say I was a bit disappointed with mine.
It appears that none of us liked the food, let’s go somewhere else for good desserts.
I’m really sorry, but I won’t be joining you in this restaurant again.




Your friend’s mother is in the hospital and needs to
have immediate surgery. Your friend is worried
about her mother’s health. You try to empathise with
her situation and console her by saying: ----Your mother’s surgery is a major one and the chances
of a full recovery seem a bit low. Good luck to your
mom.The doctors and nurses in this hospital are very
well-trained. If I needed surgery, I guess I would also
choose this hospital.Why don’t you take your mother to another doctor for
a second opinion? This might help you feel much
better and get rid of your doubts.I know it’s difficult when our loved ones are ill, but I’m
sure the operation will go well and your mother will feel
better in a very short time.Actually, my friend Jane’s mom had the same
operation three times. But she still has a lot of pain, so
I hope your mother’s will go better.You suddenly realise that you’ve completely
forgotten that yesterday was your best friend’s
birthday, because you’ve been so busy studying.
You sincerely apologise to your friend and say
you’ll make up to her for it: ----I’m so sorry I forgot about your birthday. I thought it
was in summer.My heartfelt apologies for forgetting your birthday. Let
me take you to dinner to celebrate.Sorry I forgot, but I don’t understand why some people
are so obsessed with birthdays.Forgive me for not buying you a present you'd like.
Let’s celebrate next year.I didn’t mean to forget your birthday, but I’ve just been
so busy this week.

teacher: ----It’s a shame my mother didn’t back me up. I won’t ever
talk to her again.I regret lying to you, but that’s my habit, and I can’t
help it. But why did you call my mother?Sorry, I shouldn’t have lied. The truth is I played
computer games instead of doing the homework.Sorry, I should have told you the truth. But then, you
would have been worried about my mother.I apologise to you for not handing in the assignment,
but you had given us so little time to finish it.

2018-YDT/İNGWomen are roughly twice as likely as men to suffer
from stress-related psychiatric disorders, according
to epidemiological analyses. The big question has
always been: Why? Some experts argue that cultural
factors are at least partly responsible. For instance,
women may be more willing than men to seek help
for mental illness, making their cases more likely to
be counted. ---- Scientists are uncovering telling
differences in the ways that male and female brains
react and adapt to stress.But new evidence from research suggests that biology
may also play an important role.However, scientists have studied more males than
females – even when investigating disorders.Also, it is not only the stress-related disorders that are
more prevalent among women than men.Similarly, animal studies have revealed significant
differences in stress responses.In fact, research has linked uncontrolled stress to a
wide range of mental health problems.

E)There are more than 600 ethnic or tribal groups in
Africa, and only 53 countries. Many of today’s
national boundaries were created in the late 19th
century by colonial rulers. ---- As a result, tribes are
often split between different countries. The Ewe
people, for example, are divided between Ghana and
Togo. After independence, it has often proved
difficult to create unity among the different peoples
in one country.Africa is home to about 849 million people – more than
one in eight of the world’s population.Also, groups of nomadic people, who tend to roam
together across many countries, are found throughout
western Africa.The most heavily urbanized region in Africa is
northern Africa, and Cairo, in Egypt, is the largest city
on the continent.Borders sometimes follow natural features, such as
rivers, but often they just follow straight lines on a
map.The war between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples has
forced thousands of people to leave their homes.
