Consumers purchase products and services to experience certain emotional states or achieve emotional goals in a process called emotional arousal.
Emotions can create a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction, but they can also give the consumer the perception that their purchase will help them avoid a feeling of displeasure. 
No matter what the purchase is, consumers must somehow associate a positive emotional connection between a product and themselves. 
Positive emotions can include the fulfillment of a desire or the feelings of safety and protection.
Consumers also have both unexpressed and expressed emotions. 
It is important to understand the difference between these emotions because if a consumer is purchasing but is not expressing any emotion toward a product, you may need to ask more questions in order to reach the customer on a deeper level. 
Doing so helps the consumers feel that they are somehow linked to your product and that it produces a favorable image of them. 
This reaction evokes consumer identification with your product and motivates them to buy – and keep buying – your product.

    state - durum

How does buying something affect consumers’ emotions?

    It leads to a condition of discomfort and misery.                                                     discomfort - rahatsızlık        misery - sefalet, ızdırap
    It results in a feeling of regret for purchasing too much.                                            result - sonuçlandırılmak

                     vaat etmek
A new helmet display promises to give bikers eyes in the back of their heads. 
The designer of the equipment states that the inherent problem with motorcycles is that the mirrors reflect a very small image and, because of the position of the mirrors, motorcyclists mostly just see their elbows. 
A small backlit display screen is added onto motorcycle helmets with an adjustable arm which lets riders place it just below or above their eye, in their peripheral vision. 
A rear-facing camera attached to the back of the bike streams live video via Wi-Fi to the helmet-mounted receiver. 
The images are processed and stabilised before they reach the display to accommodate for the bike’s movements. 
One glance at the display gives the rider a wide view of the road behind them. 
Although the screen is just next to the user’s face, optics fool the eye into focusing at a more comfortable distance of around 3 metres. 
However, it is still suggested that users should check their mirrors and do the lifesaver check, turning their heads to check blind spots.

inherent - doğal, doğuştan                  stream - akış sağlamak
state - belirmek                            glance - kısa bakış
elbow - dirsek                              accommodate - uyum sağlamak
backlit - arka aydınlatma                   fool
adjustable - ayarlanabilir
peripheral - dış kenara ait, çevresel

32. What is the problem regarding the motorcyclists’ vision?
    It is difficult for bikers to get a broad view of the road behind them using only their mirrors.                                                                                                                                    .a
    Fatal accidents cannot be prevented because of the limited use of mirrors.                                      prevent - engellemek
    Motorcyclists have difficulty adjusting mirrors to get images from the sides of the bike.
    The body’s position on the motorcycle does not allow the biker to see what is happening around him.
    Mirror positions constantly need to be changed to follow traffic flow.

33. It is understood from the passage that the helmet display ----.
    records the motorcycle’s movements

Today’s symphony orchestra has its roots in 17th century bands.

For centuries, the world’s physicists, writers and philosophers have argued about whether time travel is possible, with most coming to the conclusion that it is never going to happen. 
But on a large plot of land just outside the small town of Comfort, Texas, 
    a group of architects, engineers and scientists are building a ‘Timeship’ that they say it could transport tens of thousands of individuals to a far-distant future.               on binlerce kişiyi uzak bir geleceğe taşıyabilir.
Their approach does not involve the use of flux capacitors, or zooming at light-speed through black holes. 
Instead, the Timeship aims to store people at such low temperatures that their bodies are preserved for a future civilisation to reanimate them, a concept known as Cryonics.           civilization - medeniyet
“Just as a spaceship allows people to move through space, our Timeship will allow people to travel to another time in the future,” explains Stephen Valentine, 
                                                                                                                                            who is the director and principal architect of the Timeship project.

38. According to the group of architects, engineers and scientists in Texas, ----.
    the city is not really suitable for the ‘Timeship’ because it is such a small place
    it will soon be possible to transport more than 10,000 people to a far-distant future                                                                                                                                                .b
    it is possible that the bodies of people are preserved with almost no changes
    their ‘Timeship’ will have the capacity of at most 10,000 people
    time travel is not likely to take place until a far-distant future

39. According to the passage, the Timeship ----.
    is designed using the latest technology in order to reach light-speed efficiently while travelling through time
    will be able to travel through space, but will avoid black holes through the use of the most modern technology available
    is constructed in much the same way as a spaceship, but rather than travelling through space it will simply be used to freeze people 
    will not really move, but rather will show passengers a simulation of what the far-distant future might look like
    will house people who have been frozen until some time in the future, thus having time-travelled                                                                                                                                      .e

It was a road that kicked off the pattern of destruction in the Amazon forest. 
During the 1970s, Brazil began building the Trans-Amazonian Highway from near the country’s easternmost point to its western border, where the state of Amazonas meets Peru. 
The route opened up the heart of the Amazon to settlement, causing deforestation rates to increase. 
During the 1990s and early 2000s, more than 25,000 square kilometres of rainforest per year were cleared out. 
Throughout these years, roads have provided the means to penetrate the forest and eliminate large chunks of it. 
In an unpublished study of the Brazilian Amazon, researcher Christopher Barber found that 95% of deforestation in the region occurs within 7 kilometres of a road. 
Once construction begins, road crews are quickly followed by land speculators, loggers, farmers, ranchers, gold miners and others who carve away the forest along the route. 
This creates great treeless expanses in the landscape, 
    but research is now showing that the building of roads also triggers environmental changes in the remaining forest that can dry out trees, set the stage for wildfires, and weaken the ecosystem.

# 41. Which of the following can be said about the Amazon forest?
    The state of Brazil had to build roads through it for the people who were settled in the forest.
    Although it damaged the forest, the new highway enabled the people of Amazonas to better travel to Peru.
    From the 1990s onwards, 25,000 square kilometres were being cut down every year to make way for the new highway.
    The rainforest has been suffering from a pattern of destruction in a scale it had not experienced before the 1970s.                    suffer - acı çekmek        in a scale - bir ölçekte                                          .d
    Deforestation has not only affected Brazil’s eastern and western borders, but it has also started to spread through other countries.    spread - yayılmak

# 42. Which of the following best describes the relationship between road construction and deforestation?
    Since the road crews work with a lot of parties to carve away the forest, deforestation along the route is not affected at all.
    According to research on the Brazilian Amazon, a very large percentage of deforestation is a direct consequence of building the Trans-Amazonian Highway.                                                                              .b
    The highway and its branching roads were built to provide the necessary means of penetrating the forest to erase the traces of deforestation.  
    Contrary to previous beliefs, research is now showing that road crews also set fires and dry out the trees during construction work.
    Although trees were cut down for the highway resulting in treeless landscapes, this was limited to an area of within 7 kilometres of a road.

# 43. One can conclude from the passage that the author mainly ----.
    wants to warn the Brazillian state against the future consequences of their project of Trans-Amazonian Highway
    tries to point that the environmental effects of building roads are confused with the ones caused by humans
    informs the reader on the effects building a road through the forest has on the local ecosystem                                                                                                                                      .c
    criticises people contributing to the deforestation process with their work
    underlines the reasons why the Brazilian Amazon suffers more than the other parts of the forest

James: Is it possible to cite sources from the Internet in our papers?                                           Makalelerimizde internetten kaynaklardan alıntı yapmak mümkün müdür?
Vince: Well, it depends on the source you’re referring to.                                                       Bu, bahsettiğiniz kaynağa bağlı.
James: ----
Vince: Of course not. We’re writing an academic paper and all the information should be reliable.                Tabii ki değil. Akademik bir makale yazıyoruz ve tüm bilgilerin güvenilir olması gerekiyor.

    I see. Why don’t we go to the computer lab and check the database?                                           Anlıyorum. Neden bilgisayar laboratuvarına gidip veritabanını kontrol etmiyoruz?
    So are you saying that we should consult our advisors first?                                                 Yani önce danışmanlarımıza danışmamız gerektiğini mi söylüyorsunuz?
    The Internet has the necessary information. It isn’t worth going to the library, is it?                       İnternet gerekli bilgilere sahiptir. Kütüphaneye gitmeye değmez, değil mi?
    What do you mean by that? Can’t we cite every source we find online?                                         Bununla ne demek istiyorsun? İnternette bulduğumuz her kaynaktan alıntı yapamaz mıyız?                                  .d
    I didn’t get your point. Would you please be more specific?                                                  Ne demek istediğini anlamadım. Lütfen daha spesifik olur musunuz?

Jessica: Why do you think Galileo Galilei is accepted as one of the most important scientists?                                  Sizce neden Galileo Galilei en önemli bilim adamlarından biri olarak kabul ediliyor?
Robert:  Because he invented the astronomical telescope and suggested the sun-centered Solar System.                            Çünkü astronomik teleskopu icat etti ve güneş merkezli Güneş Sistemini önerdi.
Jessica: ----
Robert: It’s really surprising that you’re questioning it. His studies started everything about the Universe!                   Bunu sorgulamanız gerçekten şaşırtıcı. Onun çalışmaları Evrenle ilgili her şeyi başlattı!


Yes, I also learnt that he used improved telescopes to identify the moons of Jupiter.                                          Evet, ayrıca Jüpiter'in uydularını tespit etmek için gelişmiş teleskoplar kullandığını da öğrendim.
Doesn’t everybody know that his obsession with measurable experiments marked him as one of the founders of modern science?     Ölçülebilir deneylere olan tutkusunun onu modern bilimin kurucularından biri haline getirdiğini herkes bilmiyor mu?
He did but it’s unfortunate that his conflict with the Church led to the censorship of his publications.                        Yaptı ama ne yazık ki Kilise ile olan çatışması yayınlarının sansürlenmesine yol açtı.
I know all about this, but I just can’t understand why so many popular writers still mention him in their works.                Bunların hepsini biliyorum ama neden bu kadar çok popüler yazarın eserlerinde hâlâ ondan bahsettiğini anlayamıyorum.                              .d
Maybe you can check it online before you believe what people say about him.                                                     Belki insanların onun hakkında söylediklerine inanmadan önce internetten kontrol edebilirsiniz.

Journalist: Experts warn that food industries are being threatened by a growing resistance to antibiotics.                      Uzmanlar, gıda endüstrilerinin antibiyotiklere karşı artan direncin tehdidi altında olduğu konusunda uyarıyor.
Researcher: Yes, it's becoming more serious day by day. 
            A UK government report states that by 2050, 
            antimicrobial resistance will cost more money than the current size of the world's economy, leading to catastrophes in food production.        Antimikrobiyal direnç, dünya ekonomisinin mevcut boyutundan daha fazla paraya mal olacak ve bu da gıda üretiminde felaketlere yol açacak.
Journalist: ----
Researcher: For example, if you buy a farmed salmon today, chances are it will have eaten a greater weight of antibiotics during its life than its own body weight.        Örneğin, bugün çiftlikte yetiştirilen bir somon balığı satın alırsanız, muhtemelen yaşamı boyunca kendi vücut ağırlığından daha fazla antibiyotik yemiş olacaktır.
Journalist: So, we can say that farming practices are perfect for boosting antimicrobial resistance.                                            Dolayısıyla tarım uygulamalarının antimikrobiyal direnci artırmak için mükemmel olduğunu söyleyebiliriz.


We know that farmers rely heavily on antibiotics. What is the reason behind their practices?                                              Çiftçilerin büyük ölçüde antibiyotiklere bağımlı olduklarını biliyoruz. Bu uygulamalarının nedeni nedir?
What can health scientists and clinicians do to sort out the problem?                                                                     Sağlık bilimcileri ve klinisyenler sorunu çözmek için ne yapabilirler?
Can you tell us how antimicrobial resistance affects food?                                                                                Antimikrobiyal direncin gıdayı nasıl etkilediğini bize anlatabilir misiniz?                                                      .c
Do you think food industries could collapse if resistance spreads?                                                                        Direnç yayılırsa gıda endüstrilerinin çökebileceğini düşünüyor musunuz?
What else does the report warn us about?                                                                                                  Rapor bizi başka ne konuda uyarıyor?

Eda: I haven't seen you on social media for some time. Don't you use it any more?
Çiğdem: ----
Eda: You've done the right thing! Experts say browsing social media sites leads to depression as it triggers a feeling of envy among users.
Çiğdem: That could be true, as well. But my reason is being too busy to use it these days, not because I'm jealous of others.

I'm afraid I've forgotten my password, so I can't log in these days.
Well, seeing how people are satisfied with their lives gets on my nerves.

Fatma: ----
Mert: No, I’ve been running in the mornings for the last three months, I haven’t taken a break.

Eating healthily does not mean obsessing about the features of the specific nutrients in a meal, nor following the latest trends.                                                Sağlıklı beslenmek, bir öğündeki belirli besinlerin özelliklerine takıntılı olmak ya da son trendleri takip etmek anlamına gelmez.

Both the features of the particular nutrients in a meal and the most recent fashion should be continually followed to eat healthily.                                             Sağlıklı beslenmek için hem bir öğündeki besinlerin özellikleri hem de en son moda sürekli takip edilmelidir.

The word ‘fossil’ comes from the Latin word fossilis, meaning ‘dug up’, and that is how some fossils are discovered, although most are exposed by erosion.

Despite the fact that the word ‘fossil’ is derived from the Latin fossilis, which has the meaning ‘dug up’, not all fossils are discovered that way as they mostly appear due to erosion.                                                .a
The word ‘fossil’ which originated from the Latin word fossilis, means ‘dug up’ but the way that most of them are discovered is through their appearance after erosion.                                                                  
Unlike the ones that are discovered after appearing due to erosion, ‘fossils’ are ‘dug up’, as the meaning of the Latin word fossilis suggests.
The word ‘fossil’ is derived from the Latin word fossilis and it means being ‘dug up’ instead of being discovered after having emerged due to erosion.
Fossilis, which is the Latin origin of the word ‘fossil’, means discovered either when it is ‘dug up’ or emerged as a result of erosion.

When compared to infancy, people grow up more slowly throughout their childhood, though they gain new abilities and knowledge fast.
People get more knowledgable and develop new skills more rapidly in infancy than they do in childhood, when they grow up slowly.
The pace at which people acquire new abilities and knowledge, and grow up is more gradual in childhood than in infancy.
People who grow up faster in infancy develop new capabilities and knowledge in a longer period of time in childhood.

You and a friend are supposed to meet for dinner at a restaurant. Your friend arrives twenty minutes late
and says it was because of the traffic, which is normal in your city. 
Frustrated, you want to criticise your friend for being late, so you say: ----I know. 
The traffic is always terrible around here, especially this time of day.
If you had planned ahead and left home earlier you wouldn’t have been late.
Next time why don’t you consider taking the metro? 
It isn’t affected by the traffic.
I really wish more could be done to deal with the traffic problem in our city.
It’s okay. The food here is usually not served in a timely manner, anyway.

You and your friends went out for dinner. 
Your friends all found their meals delicious but you were dissatisfied with yours. 
You disagree with them about the quality of the food, so you say politely: ----The food was terrible. 
I’m going to write a very negative review for this restaurant.
This restaurant is very disappointing, especially the old decor and slow service.
I’m glad you all enjoyed your meals, but I must say I was a bit disappointed with mine.

mom.The doctors and nurses in this hospital are very
well-trained. If I needed surgery, I guess I would also
choose this hospital.Why don’t you take your mother to another doctor for
a second opinion? This might help you feel much
better and get rid of your doubts.I know it’s difficult when our loved ones are ill, but I’m
sure the operation will go well and your mother will feel
better in a very short time.Actually, my friend Jane’s mom had the same
operation three times. But she still has a lot of pain, so
I hope your mother’s will go better.You suddenly realise that you’ve completely
forgotten that yesterday was your best friend’s
birthday, because you’ve been so busy studying.

you’ll make up to her for it: ----I’m so sorry I forgot about your birthday. I thought it
was in summer.My heartfelt apologies for forgetting your birthday. Let
me take you to dinner to celebrate.Sorry I forgot, but I don’t understand why some people
are so obsessed with birthdays.Forgive me for not buying you a present you'd like.

2018-YDT/İNGWomen are roughly twice as likely as men to suffer
from stress-related psychiatric disorders, according
to epidemiological analyses. The big question has
always been: Why? Some experts argue that cultural
factors are at least partly responsible. For instance,
women may be more willing than men to seek help
for mental illness, making their cases more likely to
be counted. ---- Scientists are uncovering telling
differences in the ways that male and female brains
react and adapt to stress.But new evidence from research suggests that biology
may also play an important role.However, scientists have studied more males than
females – even when investigating disorders.Also, it is not only the stress-related disorders that are
more prevalent among women than men.Similarly, animal studies have revealed significant
differences in stress responses.In fact, research has linked uncontrolled stress to a
wide range of mental health problems.

E)There are more than 600 ethnic or tribal groups in
Africa, and only 53 countries. Many of today’s
national boundaries were created in the late 19th
century by colonial rulers. ---- As a result, tribes are
often split between different countries. The Ewe
people, for example, are divided between Ghana and
Togo. After independence, it has often proved
difficult to create unity among the different peoples
in one country.Africa is home to about 849 million people – more than
one in eight of the world’s population.Also, groups of nomadic people, who tend to roam
together across many countries, are found throughout
western Africa.The most heavily urbanized region in Africa is
northern Africa, and Cairo, in Egypt, is the largest city
on the continent.Borders sometimes follow natural features, such as
rivers, but often they just follow straight lines on a
map.The war between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples has
forced thousands of people to leave their homes.

The coffee tree is an evergreen. 
It grows in about 70 countries that offer suitable climates and altitudes.
---- They are picked from the tree during harvest – they contain two seeds, which after processing become coffee beans. 
The main commercially grown coffee tree species are Arabica and Robusta. 
While Robustas are high-yielding and resistant to pests and diseases, producing coffee cherries with rustic flavour, Arabicas are generally superior in flavour.

As botanists discover new species with interesting flavours, the family tree of coffee continues to grow.
The trees are cultivated with care, and grow for about 3-5 years before they flower and produce fruit, known as coffee cherries.
The movement of hot and cold air influences how the coffee cherries mature and taste.
Many coffee varieties are genetically similar, but have acquired different regional or local names.
The look and flavour of coffee are influenced by many forces, such as soil, sun exposure and rainfall patterns.


---- A baby was born with a small head caused by incomplete brain development. 
The mother likely caught the virus in Brazil. 
Meanwhile, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have advised pregnant women against travel to countries affected by the Zika virus.
It is foreseen that the US will have to face deaths caused by the Zika virus in the near future.
The first case of brain damage linked to the Zika virus
on the US soil has been reported in Hawaii.
The effects of the Zika virus have diminished dramatically in the recent years.
Brain damages caused by the Zika virus cannot be treated for the time being.
Scientists have estimated that the Zika virus may spread across Europe besides the US.



Plants and livestock need air, water, and nourishment to stay alive. 
If a plant does not have the kind of soil it needs, it may die. 
Similarly, animals also need to have the right climate and the right food to survive. 
Farmers try to raise the kinds of livestock and plants that will do well in their particular region.
---- For example, many farmers in dry areas use irrigation, or artificial watering.
Farmers raise crops and livestock in every climate and in all kinds of different soil.
Plants and animals also supply such natural materials as cotton, flax, wool, and hides.
Agriculture provides the food and many of the raw materials that humans need to survive.
Some regions receive a lot of sunlight or rainfall while others have colder or drier weather.
If they do not have perfect natural conditions, they try to create the best conditions possible.
