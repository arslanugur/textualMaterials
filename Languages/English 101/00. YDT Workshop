Consumers purchase products and services to experience certain emotional states or achieve emotional goals in a process called emotional arousal.
Emotions can create a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction, but they can also give the consumer the perception that their purchase will help them avoid a feeling of displeasure. 
No matter what the purchase is, consumers must somehow associate a positive emotional connection between a product and themselves. 
Positive emotions can include the fulfillment of a desire or the feelings of safety and protection.
Consumers also have both unexpressed and expressed emotions. 
It is important to understand the difference between these emotions because if a consumer is
purchasing but is not expressing any emotion toward a product, you may need to ask more questions in order
to reach the customer on a deeper level. Doing so helps
the consumers feel that they are somehow linked to
your product and that it produces a favorable image of
them. This reaction evokes consumer identification with
your product and motivates them to buy – and keep
buying – your product.How does buying something affect consumers’
emotions?It gives consumers a feeling of achievement.It causes consumers to have damaging thoughts.It influences every decision consumers make before
purchasing.It leads to a condition of discomfort and misery.It results in a feeling of regret for purchasing too much.
