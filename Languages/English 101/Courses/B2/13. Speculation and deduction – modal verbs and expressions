Modal verbs and expressions are commonly used in English for speculation and deduction, which involve making educated guesses or drawing conclusions based on available information. 
These linguistic tools help convey varying degrees of certainty or uncertainty when discussing possibilities or making inferences about past, present, or future situations. 
Here are some modal verbs and expressions that are used for speculation and deduction:

Modal Verbs for Speculation:

"Must": Used to express a high degree of certainty or a strong belief about something.

He must be at home. (I am quite sure he is at home.)
"Might" and "Could": Used to suggest a possibility, with "might" indicating a slightly higher probability than "could."

She might arrive late due to traffic.
He could be busy with work.
"May": Used to suggest a possibility or probability.

She may have forgotten about the meeting.
"Can't" and "Couldn't": Used to express a strong belief that something is not true or likely.

He can't have finished the project already. (I am confident he hasn't finished it.)

Expressions for Speculation and Deduction:

"It looks like": Indicates an impression or inference based on visual or situational evidence.

It looks like it's going to rain.
"It seems that": Suggests an observation or conclusion based on available information.

It seems that prices have increased recently.
"I reckon" or "I guess": Informal expressions used to indicate personal estimation or speculation.

I reckon he'll be here in about 15 minutes.
"From what I can tell": Used to introduce a deduction based on one's understanding or perception.

From what I can tell, they're having a good time.
"It's possible/probable/likely": Expresses different levels of likelihood or probability.

It's possible that they're stuck in traffic.
"I have a feeling": Indicates a hunch or intuition about a situation.

I have a feeling that the presentation went well.
"I wouldn't be surprised if": Used to suggest that something is quite likely to happen based on the situation.

I wouldn't be surprised if they choose her for the role.
Remember that the choice of modal verbs and expressions depends on the context and the degree of certainty you want to convey. 
Also, when speculating about the past, you'll generally use modal verbs in the perfect form 
(e.g., "He must have left" to indicate a strong belief about a past action).


Example:
"She must have missed the train because she's not here yet."
"It looks like they've been renovating the house."
"I guess he didn't receive my message."
These tools help you communicate your thoughts and ideas about uncertain situations or make educated guesses in a nuanced manner.
