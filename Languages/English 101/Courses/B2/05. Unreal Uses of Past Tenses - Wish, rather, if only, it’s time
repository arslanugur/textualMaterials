The past tenses can be used in combination with phrases like "wish," "rather," "if only," and "it's time" to express unreal or hypothetical situations. 
These structures often convey a sense of regret, desire, or unrealized wishes. 
Here are some examples of how these phrases can be used with past tenses to express such meanings:

1. Wish:

    She wishes she had traveled more when she was younger.       (She didn't travel much, and now she regrets not doing so.)
    I wish I hadn't eaten so much cake at the party.             (I did eat a lot of cake, and now I regret it.)
    He wishes he had taken that job offer when it was available. (He didn't take the job offer, and now he regrets it.)



2. Rather:
    I would rather you hadn't told him about the surprise party.            (You did tell him, and I wish you hadn't.)

3. If Only:
    If only I had known about the traffic, I would have left earlier.                 (I didn't know about the traffic, and I regret it now.)
    If only they had listened to my advice, they wouldn't be in this situation.       (They didn't listen to my advice, and I wish they had.)
    If only I had saved more money when I was younger.                                (I didn't save enough money, and I regret it now.)
    If only they had arrived on time, they wouldn't have missed the opening ceremony. (They didn't arrive on time, and they missed the ceremony.)


4. It's Time:
    It's time she had found a new job.                                (She hasn't found a new job yet, and it's about time she did.)
    It's time we had started working on the project.                  (We haven't started yet, and it's time we did.)

These structures allow you to express unreal or hypothetical situations in the past, 
        often with a sense of wishing for a different outcome or expressing regret over something that didn't happen. 
They are useful for conveying emotions and nuances in your language.
