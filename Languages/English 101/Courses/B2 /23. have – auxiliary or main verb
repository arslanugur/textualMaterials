The verb "have" can function as both an auxiliary verb and a main verb in English, depending on how it is used in a sentence.

# Auxiliary Verb (Used in Verb Tenses and Aspect):

As an auxiliary verb, "have" is often used to form different verb tenses and express aspect in combination with the past participle of another verb. 
It helps indicate actions that are completed or ongoing. Here are some examples of "have" as an auxiliary verb:
Present Perfect: She has finished her homework.
Past Perfect: They had already left when we arrived.
Future Perfect: By next year, I will have graduated.


# Main Verb (Expressing Possession or Action):

As a main verb, "have" is used to express possession, experience, or actions. In this role, "have" functions like any other main verb and can take various forms (infinitive, gerund, etc.).
Possession: She has a beautiful house.
Experience: I have never been to Paris.
Action: They have a meeting later today.
It's important to note that the distinction between "have" as an auxiliary verb and "have" as a main verb affects the grammatical structure and meaning of the sentence. 
In auxiliary constructions, "have" combines with another verb to indicate tense or aspect, while in main verb constructions, "have" stands alone to convey possession, experience, or action.

In summary, "have" is a versatile verb that can serve as both an auxiliary verb, helping to form various tenses and express aspect, and a main verb, expressing possession, experience, or actions. 
The role of "have" in a sentence determines its grammatical function and meaning.
