Relative clauses are clauses that provide additional information about a noun in a sentence. 
They begin with a relative pronoun (such as "who," "whom," "whose," "which," or "that") or a relative adverb (such as "where," "when," or "why"). 
Relative clauses can be either defining (restrictive) or non-defining (non-restrictive), and they serve different purposes in a sentence.



Defining Relative Clauses:
Defining relative clauses provide essential information that helps identify or define the noun they modify. Without this information, the sentence might be unclear or incomplete. 
Defining relative clauses are not separated by commas.

Examples:
The book that I borrowed from the library is very interesting.
The person who won the competition is my friend.
In these examples, the relative clauses "that I borrowed from the library" and "who won the competition" are essential to understanding which book and which person are being referred to.





Non-Defining Relative Clauses:
Non-defining relative clauses provide additional information that is not necessary for identifying the noun they modify. 
They offer extra details, but the main sentence would still make sense without them. Non-defining relative clauses are usually separated by commas.

Examples:
My brother, who is an engineer, is moving to a new city.
Paris, where I lived for three years, is a beautiful city.
In these examples, the relative clauses "who is an engineer" and "where I lived for three years" provide extra information but can be removed without affecting the main meaning of the sentences.

It's important to note that in non-defining relative clauses, "which" is often used instead of "that" for inanimate objects, and "who" is used for people. 
Additionally, possessive relative pronouns like "whose" can be used in both defining and non-defining clauses.

In summary:
Defining relative clauses are essential to the sentence's meaning and are not separated by commas.
Non-defining relative clauses provide extra information and are set off by commas.
Understanding the distinction between these two types of relative clauses helps ensure clear and effective communication in writing and speaking.
