# Subjunctive Mood (Dilek Kipi)
    The subjunctive mood is a verb form used to express hypothetical, unreal, or doubtful situations in English. 
    It is not as commonly used in English as in some other languages, but it is still present in certain contexts. 
    The subjunctive mood is often used after certain verbs or expressions to convey wishes, suggestions, making proposals, recommendations, doubts, possibilities, and hypothetical situations.

    In English, the subjunctive mood is primarily visible in the present tense, though there is a past subjunctive form as well. 
    The subjunctive mood is often identical to the base form of the verb, except for the third person singular form of the present tense.

    
    Wishes and Suggestions:
        I wish she were here. (hypothetical situation - she is not here)
        The teacher suggested that he study harder. (recommendation)
        If I were you
        I wish you were here
        If only I were taller
        I would rather he played outside more often instead of always sitting on the computer.


    Requests and Commands:
        It is essential that she be on time. (request)
        God save the Queen. (command - as in a national anthem)
    
    Doubts and Hypothetical Situations:
        If I were you, I would take that job. (hypothetical situation - I am not you)
        I suggested he buy a new car. (hypothetical - he may not buy it)
        If she were in this situation, she would do it differently

    Expressions:
        He demanded that she leave immediately. (strong request)
        It's important that you be honest. (emphasis)

    Expressions of Necessity:
        It is necessary that he arrive on time. (necessity)

        Note: In the present subjunctive, the third person singular is formed by using the base form of the verb without adding "-s" or "-es." 
        For example, "I suggest that he go" (present subjunctive), not "goes" (simple present).

            Essay Examples:
                School boards have the power to change this situation. 
                "Were they", for example, "to mandate that every school employ" a nutritionist to oversee cafeteria offerings as well as conduct healthy eating workshops,
                "this could easily change" the reality on the ground and going forward.

                Many politicians are loath to fight climate change
                because they fear they will be blamed for the high costs of doing this
                and lose their next election battle.
                This is why "it is crucial that the electorate be supportive" of these initiatives.

                There are those who have not yet realized that "wishing one were" successful is not going to make one so;
                it is only through hard work and dedication that a person finds success.

                In my opinion, schools ought to "insist that every instructor take" additional courses throughout his or her tenure in order to keep up with the latest trends in pedagogy.

                Thus, "it is imperative that" decisions of this nature "not be left" to those unqualified to make them.

# Subjunctive Verb Forms
  # Present Subjunctive
  The present subjunctive uses the base form of the verb with all subjects.
  We use the present subjunctive to talk about a present or future hypothetical

  Example:
  I suggested he stop eating out so often if he wants to save money.
                 ----> base form, not stops...

                 ----> base form, but you cant see the subjunctive mood...

  # Past Subjunctive
  In the past subjunctive, we use the past simple form or, with be, we use were with all subjects
         ----------------             ------------              --         ----                                      

  We use the past subjunctive to talk about things we wish were true or that we wish had happened in the past.

  We often use the past subjunctive in subordinate clauses that begin with as though, as if and if, as well as with the verb wish.
                                                                           ---------  -----     --                           ----
