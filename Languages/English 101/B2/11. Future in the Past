"Future in the past" is a grammatical concept used to describe actions or events that were seen as future from a specific point in the past. 
In other words, it refers to talking about the future from a past perspective. 
English has specific verb forms and structures to express this idea. 


1. Would:
"Would" is often used in the past to express the future from a past point of view.
    She said she would call me later.                                           (From her past perspective, in the future she intended to call.)
    He promised he would help with the project.                                 (In the past, he made a promise about a future action.)
    She was confident that, with enough practice, she would become a renowned violinist.
    Despite the challenges, he believed he would eventually succeed in his ambitious project.
    Back in 2005, he said he would become a famous actor.                     (2005 is the past point of reference, and the statement about becoming a famous actor was a future projection from that point.)
    She thought that by this time, we would have flying cars.                 (The time when she thought about flying cars is in the past, and her projection of having flying cars is now also in the past.)
    In the 1960s, scientists believed we would have colonies on Mars by 2020. (The belief about colonies on Mars was held in the past, and 2020 is now in the past relative to the present date.)


2. Was/Were Going To:
The past form of "be going to" can be used to express future plans or intentions from a past standpoint.
    I thought she was going to attend the meeting.                               (In the past, I believed she had plans to attend the meeting.)
    He said he was going to visit his parents next week.                         (He expressed his intention to visit from a past perspective.)
    At that time, they were going to be celebrating their 25th anniversary.
    She was convinced that, by this point, they would be enjoying their vacation on a tropical island.



3. Past Continuous for Future Arrangements:
The past continuous tense can be used to express future actions that were planned or arranged from a past perspective.
    At that time, they were flying to Paris.         (From a past point of view, the flight was arranged.)
    I heard she was coming to the party.             (In the past, there was an arrangement for her to attend.)


4. Future Perfect in the Past:
The past form of the future perfect tense can be used to describe actions that were expected to be completed by a certain time in the future, from a past viewpoint.
    She thought she would have finished the report by now.     (In the past, she anticipated completing the report by a present time.)
    He believed they would have arrived by midnight.           (From a past perspective, he expected their arrival by a certain time.)



Using these structures, you can talk about events that were planned, expected, intended, or predicted 
        from a past vantage point, creating a narrative that involves both the past and future aspects of a situation.
