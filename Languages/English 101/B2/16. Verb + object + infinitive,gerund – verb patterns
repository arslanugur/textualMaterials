In English, certain verbs are followed by specific patterns involving an object followed by an infinitive or gerund. 
These patterns can sometimes change the meaning of the sentence or reflect the way the action is performed. 
Here are some common verb patterns with an object followed by an infinitive or gerund:

Remember that these patterns may have specific meanings or nuances, 
      and the choice of infinitive or gerund can affect the overall meaning of the sentence.

It's essential to consider the context and intended meaning when choosing the appropriate verb pattern.
