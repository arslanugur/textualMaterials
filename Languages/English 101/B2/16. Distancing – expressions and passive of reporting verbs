Distancing in writing or speech involves using reporting verbs and passive voice constructions to create a sense of objectivity or detachment from the information being presented. 
This can be particularly useful when discussing controversial, sensitive, or impersonal topics. 
Here are some expressions and passive forms of reporting verbs that can help achieve distancing:

Passive Voice:

The passive voice can be used to shift the focus from the person performing the action to the action itself. 
This can create a sense of objectivity and detachment.

Active: He claimed that the company had achieved record profits.
Passive: It was claimed that record profits had been achieved by the company.
Impersonal Reporting Verbs:

Impersonal reporting verbs allow you to present information without explicitly identifying the speaker or the source. 
This can create a sense of distance from the reported information.

It is said that...
It has been reported that...
It was suggested that...
It was believed that...
It can be argued that...
Modal Verbs of Hedging:

Modal verbs can be used to introduce a level of uncertainty or tentativeness, which can create a sense of distancing.

He might be considered as a potential candidate.
She could be seen as a leading expert in the field.
It may be argued that...
Neutral Reporting Verbs:

Using neutral reporting verbs can help present information without adding personal judgment or emotion.

He stated that...
She reported that...
They announced that...
The data indicates that...
The study revealed that...
Indirect Speech:

Using indirect speech to report statements can help distance the speaker from the reported information.

Direct: "I will not be attending the meeting," she said.
Indirect: She said that she would not be attending the meeting.
Cautious Language:

Utilizing cautious language can help create a sense of distance by acknowledging potential limitations or alternative viewpoints.

From my perspective, it seems that...
To a certain extent, it could be argued that...
There is some evidence to suggest that...
Quotative Reporting:

Presenting information as a quotation can provide a clear separation between the speaker and the reported content.

"This phenomenon is consistent with the findings of previous research," Smith (2019) noted.
Remember that the level of distancing you use depends on the context and your communicative goals. 
By employing these expressions and passive constructions, you can achieve a more objective and detached tone in your writing or speech.
