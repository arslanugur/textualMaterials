Cleft sentences are a grammatical structure used in English to add emphasis to a specific part of a sentence. 
They allow you to highlight a particular element by splitting the sentence into two parts. 
Cleft sentences are composed of a main clause and a subordinate clause, 
            often introduced by words like "it," "what," "who," "when," "where," and "how." 

Here are some examples and explanations of cleft sentences:

1. It-Cleft Sentences:
In an it-cleft sentence, "it" is used as a subject, followed by a form of the verb "to be," and then the emphasized element.

      Example:
      Normal Sentence: She is the captain of the team.
      Cleft Sentence: It is she who is the captain of the team.


2. Wh-Cleft Sentences:
In a wh-cleft sentence, a wh-word (e.g., what, who, when, where, how) is used to introduce the subordinate clause.

      Example:
      Normal Sentence: John helped us a lot.
      Cleft Sentence: What John did was help us a lot.

3. Cleft Sentences for Emphasis:
      Cleft sentences are often used to emphasize a specific part of the sentence, whether it's the subject, object, or some other element.

      Example:
      Normal Sentence: She will finish the project by Friday.
      Cleft Sentence: It's by Friday that she will finish the project.

4. Cleft Sentences for Contrast:
Cleft sentences can also be used to contrast two elements in the sentence, making the emphasis on the difference.

      Example:
      Normal Sentence: I read the book, not you.
      Cleft Sentence: It was I who read the book, not you.

5. Cleft Sentences for Focus:
Cleft sentences help you focus the reader's attention on a specific detail, making it stand out.

      Example:
      Normal Sentence: The concert was amazing.
      Cleft Sentence: What was amazing was the concert.


Cleft sentences can be a powerful tool to emphasize, clarify, or highlight certain aspects of your writing. 
However, they are more commonly used in formal writing, speech, or presentations rather than casual conversation. 
Keep in mind that while cleft sentences can add emphasis, overusing them may make your writing seem unnatural or overly complex.
