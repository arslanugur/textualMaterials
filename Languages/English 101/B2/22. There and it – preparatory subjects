"There" and "it" are both examples of preparatory subjects used in English. 
Preparatory subjects are temporary subjects placed at the beginning of a sentence to prepare the reader or listener for the main subject and verb that will follow later in the sentence. 
They are often used for stylistic or structural reasons. Let's explore how "there" and "it" function as preparatory subjects:

There:

"There" is frequently used as a preparatory subject in sentences that introduce a location or the existence of something. The main subject and verb usually come after "there."

Examples:

There is a park near my house. (Preparatory subject: "There is")
There were many people at the party. (Preparatory subject: "There were")
In both examples, "there" prepares the reader or listener for what is coming next in the sentence.

It:

"It" is often used as a preparatory subject in sentences to introduce a situation, event, or idea. The main subject and verb usually come after "it."

Examples:

It is important to stay hydrated. (Preparatory subject: "It is")
It seems like there will be rain tomorrow. (Preparatory subject: "It seems like")
In these sentences, "it" serves as a placeholder to introduce the main idea of the sentence.

Both "there" and "it" help set the stage for the rest of the sentence by providing context or introducing the main subject and verb that will follow. 
These preparatory subjects are common in English and are used to create a smoother flow of information and engage the reader or listener's attention.
