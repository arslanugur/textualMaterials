The sentence "If I were you, I wouldn't have done it" is an example of a mixed conditional sentence. 
      It combines elements of the second conditional and the third conditional.

Second Conditional (If I were you): The "if" clause uses the second conditional, which is typically used to talk about unreal or unlikely situations in the present or future. 
In this case, "If I were you" implies a hypothetical situation where the speaker is putting themselves in the listener's position.

Third Conditional (I wouldn't have done it): The main clause uses the third conditional, which is used to talk about past unreal situations that didn't happen. 
"I wouldn't have done it" suggests that the speaker is referring to a past action that the listener took, implying regret or a different choice that should have been made.

So, the sentence "If I were you, I wouldn't have done it" is expressing a hypothetical scenario (using the second conditional) 
    and commenting on a past action (using the third conditional) that the speaker believes should not have been done, given the imaginary situation.

This type of mixed conditional sentence is often used to give advice, criticize a past decision, or offer a different perspective on a situation.


      Examples:
      If I had studied harder in school, I might have gotten into my dream university.
            This sentence combines the third conditional (past unreal action) with a present or future consequence.

      If I had known you were coming, I would have baked a cake.
            Here, the speaker is using the third conditional for a past unreal situation 
                  and a second conditional structure for the present consequence.

      If you hadn't helped me, I would still be struggling with that problem.
            The third conditional is used for a past unreal action, 
            and the main clause is a second conditional structure for a present or future result.

      If it weren't for his advice, I might have made a terrible mistake.
            In this sentence, the speaker is using the second conditional (hypothetical) in the "if" clause 
                              and the third conditional (past unreal) in the main clause.

      If I were a better cook, I would have prepared a gourmet meal for the party.
            This sentence combines the second conditional for a hypothetical situation with the third conditional for a past unreal action.

      If we had left earlier, we wouldn't have missed the beginning of the movie.
            Here, the "if" clause uses the third conditional (past unreal), 
            and the main clause uses the second conditional (present or future consequence).

      If I had known about the traffic, I wouldn't have taken this route.
            The speaker is using the third conditional (past unreal) to talk about not having known something in the past, leading to a different action.
      
      If she were more organized, she might have finished the project on time.
            This sentence combines the second conditional for a hypothetical situation with the third conditional for a past unreal result.
