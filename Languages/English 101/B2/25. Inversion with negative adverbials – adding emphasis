Inversion with negative adverbials is a grammatical structure in English that involves reversing the standard word order of a sentence to add emphasis. 
This inversion is used with negative adverbials at the beginning of a sentence. 
It is a stylistic device that draws attention to the negative aspect of the sentence. Here's how it works:

Standard Word Order: Subject + Verb + Rest of the Sentence

Inverted Order with Negative Adverbial: Negative Adverbial + Auxiliary Verb (if present) + Subject + Verb + Rest of the Sentence

Negative adverbials that can trigger this type of inversion include "never," "seldom," "rarely," "hardly," "scarcely," "little," "nowhere," "in no way," "in no case," "on no account," etc.

Examples of Inversion with Negative Adverbials for Emphasis:

Standard Word Order:
She rarely goes to the gym.

Inverted Order with Negative Adverbial for Emphasis:
Rarely does she go to the gym.

Standard Word Order:
We never expected such an outcome.

Inverted Order with Negative Adverbial for Emphasis:
Never did we expect such an outcome.

Standard Word Order:
He hardly ever complains about anything.

Inverted Order with Negative Adverbial for Emphasis:
Hardly ever does he complain about anything.

Inversion with negative adverbials is used primarily in formal or literary contexts and serves to highlight the unexpected or emphasized nature of the negative adverbial. 
It adds a rhetorical effect and can make sentences sound more impactful or poetic. 
This type of inversion is not as common in everyday speech but is frequently encountered in written English, especially in literature, speeches, or academic writing.
