Reflexive and reciprocal pronouns are types of pronouns used in English to indicate actions 
    that involve the subject of the sentence either performing an action on itself (reflexive) or performing an action with others (reciprocal). 
Let's explore both types of pronouns:

Reflexive Pronouns:
Reflexive pronouns are used when the subject of a sentence performs an action on itself. 
They are formed by adding "-self" (singular) or "-selves" (plural) to certain pronouns. Here are the reflexive pronouns:

Singular: Myself, Yourself, Himself, Herself, Itself
Plural: Ourselves, Yourselves, Themselves

Examples:
She washed herself.
They congratulated themselves on their success.
He hurt himself while playing soccer.


Reciprocal Pronouns:
Reciprocal pronouns are used when two or more people or things are performing an action on each other. 
The reciprocal pronoun in English is "each other" for two people/things and "one another" for more than two. 

  Here are some examples:
  They hugged each other.
  We help one another.
  Jane and Mike always support each other.
  It's important to note that not all actions between two or more people/things are reciprocal. 
  For instance, "They greeted each other" is a reciprocal action, while "They saw each other" is not reciprocal; it just indicates two separate actions of seeing.

Reflexive and Reciprocal Pronouns in Action:
Let's see how both types of pronouns are used in sentences:

Reflexive:
She looked at herself in the mirror.
I need to take care of myself.

Reciprocal:
They talked to each other for hours.
The teams competed against one another in a friendly match.
Remember that reflexive and reciprocal pronouns are used to clarify the relationship between the subject(s) and the action(s) in the sentence. 
It's essential to use them correctly to avoid confusion and to accurately convey the intended meaning.
