Modal verbs in English are a group of auxiliary verbs that are used to express various shades of meaning such as permission, obligation, prohibition, and necessity. 
They modify the main verb in a sentence and help convey the speaker's attitude or viewpoint. 
Here's an overview of how modal verbs are used to express these different concepts:

Permission:
"Can" and "May" are used to ask for or grant permission:
Can I go to the party? (asking for permission)
May I use your phone? (asking for permission)
You can go to the park. (granting permission)
You may leave the room. (granting permission)

Obligation:
"Must" and "Have to" are used to express obligations or duties:
I must finish my homework before I go out.
You have to attend the meeting.
She mustn't forget to send the report.

Prohibition:
"Must not" and "Mustn't" are used to express prohibition (something that is not allowed):
You must not enter this area.
Students mustn't use their phones during the exam.


Necessity:
"Must" can also be used to express necessity:
We must prepare for the upcoming presentation.
You must take care of your health.

"Need to" and "Have to" can also express necessity:
I need to finish this project by tomorrow.
We have to find a solution to the problem.
It's important to note that the use of these modal verbs can vary based on tense, subject, and context. 
Additionally, the strength of the obligation, permission, prohibition, or necessity can be modified by adverbs or other words in the sentence.

Examples:
"You should study for the test." (mild suggestion)
"You ought to apologize for your behavior." (strong suggestion)
"You don't have to attend the meeting if you're busy." (no obligation)
"You really ought not to speak to him that way." (strong prohibition)

Remember that modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb (infinitive without "to"), 
        except for "have to" which is followed by the base form as well.

Keep in mind that the usage of modal verbs can be nuanced, and understanding the context is crucial for accurate communication.
