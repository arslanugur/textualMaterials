I am writing this letter for my former employee M from Gaziantep Province.
I am her former Headmaster. I have known her for about three years.
She taught at my school in 2019-2021. She occasionally talked about talking to a man named Hakan from her hometown and that she wanted to get married.
One day, on 18 December 2021, she and Hakan came to my school to meet and visit us.
Me and the School staff loved them very much and saw them very happy.
She said that they would marry Hakan and that she would go from the city.
On 20 December 2021, they left the city to prepare for marriage.
I could not attend the ceremony due to my job, but I witnessed their pictures and happiness from their social media accounts.
I hope they will be very happy for the rest of their lives.
