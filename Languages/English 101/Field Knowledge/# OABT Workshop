22.e
A perennially contentious issue in English is the search for a gender-neutral third-person singular pronoun.        İngilizce'de her zaman tartışmalı bir konu, cinsiyet ayrımı gözetmeyen üçüncü tekil şahıs zamirinin araştırılmasıdır.
Generally, he is taken as the default, as in “If someone calls, let him know I’ll be back at 3 p.m.” ----           Genellikle, "Biri ararsa ona saat 15:00'te döneceğimi bildirin" örneğinde olduğu gibi varsayılan olarak alınır. ----
He or she is long and complicated, and constructs like s/he or (s)he or he/she have never caught on, probably       Uzun ve karmaşıktır ve muhtemelen hiç anlamadığı gibi yapılar kurar.
because they sound artifical (and how would you even pronounce them?)                                               çünkü kulağa yapay geliyorlar (ve onları nasıl telaffuz edersiniz?)
And one, as in “One must fill in and sign this form.” sounds literary or too formal.                                Ve bir, "Bu formu doldurup imzalamanız gerekiyor." kulağa edebi ya da fazla resmi geliyor.
For some, to change the default to she would be unthinkable.                                                        Bazıları için varsayılanı o olarak değiştirmek düşünülemezdi.

Which of the following completes the paragraph?
    The use of masculine, feminine, or neutral genders to classify words does not require its speakers to conceptualise these words as having male- or female-like properties.
    Some professional authors using the default he think that the so-called generic pronoun he/him/his was an invention of male grammarians.
    There are still many other cases of gender bias in the English lexicon; for example, chairman, salesman, businessman, and policeman are among the most debated ones.
    Since the 1970s, the feminist movement has had an impact on changing at least some of the subtle sexism in English.
    In fact, there is no easy choice if someone wants to avoid this, because none of the seemingly practical suggestions have been largely accepted.

Complementaries display a type of oppositeness of meaning, illustrated by pairs such as single/married and husband/wife. 
Single is said to be the complementary of married and vice versa.

In addition, the relation of ‘complementarity’ is characterised by the lack of any gradability between the items.

    In mourning wise since daily I increase,
    Thus should I cloak the cause of all my grief;
    So pensive mind with tongue to hold his peace
    My reason sayeth there can be no relief:
    Wherefore give ear, I humbly you require,
    The affect to know that thus doth make me moan.
    The cause is great of all my doleful cheer
    For those that were, and now be dead and gone.

In the table below, principles of some certain methods/approaches are given:
    Methods & Approaches        Principles
    x                            It integrates the learning of language into the learning of academic subjects, such as history or geography.
                                 Learners work with cognitively demanding language within the context of authentic tasks, 
                                  and they are given multiple opportunities to use the new language they acquire as they read, discuss, and write about specific topics.
                                 Vocabulary is easier to acquire when there are contextual clues to help convey meaning.
                                
    y                            Speech is more basic to language than the written form, and speaking and listening skills are prioritised.
                                 The teacher presents grammatical points through examples, hence employing inductive teaching of grammar.
                                 Errors must be corrected immediately because they lead to the formation of bad habits.

Below are statements by English language teachers about their role in the classroom. 
Each teacher adopts a different method/approach in teaching English.
    In which option is there a mismatch between the method/approach and the corresponding teacher’s role?

        The Grammar-Translation Method – My main role is to help my learners read and write in English, and I’m the authority in the classroom.
        The Audio-Lingual Method – My main role is to direct the language behaviour of my learners. 
                                  I should provide a good role model, and the learners should become good imitators.
        Desuggestopedia – I’m responsible for creating a cheerful learning environment for my learners. If they trust me, they can feel more secure.
        Community Language Learning – Error correction is important as errors lead to the formation of bad habits. So, I immediately correct them when they occur.
        Communicative Language Teaching – Facilitating communication is my ultimate goal as a teacher.  To this end, my main responsibility is to create situations that are likely to promote interaction.

There is a great deal of difference between the way words are pronounced in isolation and their pronunciation in the context of connected speech.
Regarding this fact, Mr Roach shows the following phrases to his intermediate-level students:
     my turn /maɪ tɜ:n/ (the aɪ diphthong is longer in ‘my’, t is fully aspirated when initial in ‘turn')
     might earn /maɪt ɜ:n/ (the aɪ diphthong is shorter in ‘might’, t is unaspirated when final in ‘might’)
Which feature of pronunciation is being taught by Mr Roach through the examples above?
    Elision 
    Intrusion
    Assimilation 
    Dissimilation
    Juncture

72.c
Which of the following is true of child grammar?
    The differences between child grammar and adult grammar are viewed as linguistic failures.

    Child grammar as demonstrated in novel utterances is limited to repeating what children have heard.
    With additional stimuli, children can master linguistic complexities which are beyond their present grasp, no matter what their age is.
