C1 ve C2 seviyeleri,

1.Do you believe the issue of global warming is a serious concern for the world and what kind of measures should be taken in order the fight the adverse effects of the issue?
2.How would a country balance its economy and current account deficit?
3.How would you compare China and US? In what ways you think they are similar or different?
4.Does the world need a global currency? Why?


B2 ve C1’i nasıl ayırt ederim?
B2 seviyesi ve C1 seviyesinde olan bir öğrenci fluency olarak hemen hemen aynı hızda konuşurlar 
fakat B2’yi C1’den ayıran en büyük şey kelime seçimleridir, C1 seviyesinde teknik terimler ve vocabulary deki genel range dikkate alınmaktadır. 
Öğrenci hemen hemen hiç düşünmeden B2 seviyesindeki sorularınıza cevap verebiliyorsa B2 bulunduğu seviye, C1 başlayacağı seviye olarak değerlendirilebilir.


C1 ve C2 seviyeleri genel ingilizce için çok nadir çıkmakla birlikte genelde sınav veya özel dersler için gelirler. 
TOEFL veya IELTS en çok aldığımız sınav çalışmalarıdır. 
Öğrenciler bu eğitimlere başlamadan önce en az B2 seviyesinden mezun olmuş olmalıdırlar. 

Not: Yukarıdaki sorular örnek olup, eğitmen tarafından çeşitlendirilip modifiye edilmeye açıktır.
