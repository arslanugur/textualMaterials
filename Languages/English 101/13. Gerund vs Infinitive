GERUND vs INFINITIVE                                                                    prepared by Uğur ARSLAN, @arslanuguur

---> Fiilden isim yapma
INFINITIVE        --- to go          eyleme yönelme, yeni yapmaya başlamak
GERUND            --- going          fiili aktiviteleştirmek, fiili isimleştirmek (ikinci fiili, fiil olmaktan çıkarmak), eylemi daha önceden yapmak
                            * Bazı cümlelerde 'gizli preposition' olabilir. Bu yüzden gerund kullanılır. Bunun anlamı, fiilin isimleşmesidir. 
                              Çünkü her preposition sonrasında isim/noun ya da pronoun/zamir alır.
                            * Sıfat/Adjective sonrası infinitive kullanılır.
