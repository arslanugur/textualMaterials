Conjunctions & Bridging Words
https://7esl.com/transition-words/

https://englishlessonsbrighton.co.uk/different-types-of-conjunctions-definitions-uses-and-examples/
Transitions connect ideas at the level of paragraphs or larger units of text, while conjunctions connect elements within a sentence. 
Additionally, transitions signal the relationship between ideas, while conjunctions connect elements of equal or unequal importance within a sentence.


What is the difference between conjunctions and linking words? A conjunction connects any parts of speech, and there are 6 of them: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so. 
The only linking words in English are linking verbs, and they link the verb part of the sentence back to the subject.

# Conjunctions
Coordinating conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)
Correlative conjunctions (and/or, not only/but also)
Subordinating conjunctions (when, because, although, while, since...)
Conjunctive adverbs (however, therefore)
