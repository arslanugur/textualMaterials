Chemistry Prefixes
In chemistry prefixes are used to name various compounds. These prefixes denote the number of a given element within a compound.
    1 â€“ mono, 2 â€“ di, 3 â€“ tri, 4 â€“ tetra, 5 â€“ penta, 6 â€“ hexa, 7 â€“ hepta, 8 â€“ octa, 9 â€“ nona, 10 â€“ deca
Examples: nitrogen trihydride, copper sulfate pentahydrate, bicarbon sulfate, etc.

Prefix herbicide is an American product that is manufactured in the US, and used to treat various types of grass. It is a selective herbicide and can be applied to different types of grassy terrain, as well as come crops. PREFIX is the name of manufacturer.
.Are prefix allowed in scrabble?
Prefixes by themselves are not allowed in Scrabble. This means that just putting any prefix such as post-, pre-, neo-, eb-, or others, is not allowed.
However, you can use words that are built with prefixes. Only complete words are allowed in Scrabble. This means that you can use postmodernism, instead of just modernism.
Can prefix be a noun / verb / plural?
Prefixes as grammatical elements are not complete words. They cannot be any type of word except a prefix. Prefixes are used to change words and are always added to another type of words.
The only case when prefixes are complete words is when two or more words are hyphenated together. Some examples are jet-black, tar-runway, hot-blooded, and others. In this case, two full words are connected with a hyphen.
