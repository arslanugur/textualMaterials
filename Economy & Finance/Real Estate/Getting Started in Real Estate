Residential Real Estate
Residential real estate generates high and reliable cash flow.
The most obvious advantage of residential real estate is the sheer amount of cashflow that it could potentially generate.
Unlike other types of businesses, the income from a residential property is relatively predictable and stable.

# Fantastic Fear...
  What if i buy a house and no one rents it?...
  higher price = higher risk
    the cost of the mortgage they couldnt collect enough rent to pay for it..
    almost nobody is willing to rent a million dollar home, dont buy an expensive stuff and never buy above the median...
  but if you pick simple house so called single family real estate, you pick up the highest percentage of cash flow positive.
  + bir eve çok masraf yaparsan lokasyonuna göre daha yüksek bir fiyatla listenmek zorunda kalır, bu da satış hızını olumsuz etkiler...
  + someone needs to evaluate the numbers...
