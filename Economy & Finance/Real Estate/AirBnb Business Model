what if we rent a property and list it on airbnb?
The need is a corporate lease with subletting permission
many landlords were losing money cause of vacancy
the need is talking with landlords

the deal:
1. guaranteed rent paid on time
2. no voids
3. property stays clean
4. no parties

after rejections, finally signed 3 corporate leases
$13k loan is used to pay for rent, deposit, agent fee, furniture
In the first month 2000$ made in profit
Afterwards, more business loans and furniture leases
3 airbnb turned into 10 airbnb
10 airbnb turned into 30 airbnb
30 airbnb turned into 100 airbnb by '25
