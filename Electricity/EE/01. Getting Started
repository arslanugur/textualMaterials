01.01. Current
Current is the flow charge
'+' ->  <- '-'
<- '+'  '+' ->
<- '-'  '-' ->

CU - Cooper (29)
29 Protons
29 Electrons

Copper and silver atoms have loose electrons, making them good conductors. 


q = charge

      current = q/sec
    -------------------                  01.02. Current direction
          plus  --->    -                plus current (positive direction)  = q+
+   <---  minus                          minus current (negative direction)  = q- ????  electron (negative charge)

01.03. Voltage
Voltage and Gravity are similar ideas
high voltage = high mountain
low voltage = low mountain
buy batteries and we do our circuit design


01.04. Conventional Current Direction
