Major Arcana: The Fool's Journey
The Major Arcana is a 22 card set within the tarot that is considered to be the core and the foundation for the deck. 
All of the deck is filled with archetypal significance, but this is most pronounced within the Major Arcana. 
These cards follow a storyline that tells of the spiritual travels taken from the innocent wonder of The Fool to the oneness and fulfillment of The World. 
In other words, these cards tell the story of humanity's spiritual evolution into enlightenment and individuation.
And so, as we follow the journey of the Fool, we can start seeing common parallels between our own stages in life and those in the cards, each card teaching a specific lesson and a concept to meditate over. 
Because they form the basis of the tarot, some readings can sometimes be conducted with only the Major Arcana as well.
