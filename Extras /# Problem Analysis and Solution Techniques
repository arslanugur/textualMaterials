# Seven Problem Solving Models

- Scientific Method
        Ask a Question -> Do Background Research -> Construct and Test and Hypothesis --> YES/NO -> Analyse data and Draw Conclusions --> Result Align or not? -> Communicate results

- Problem Solving Model
        Define the problem -> Determine Boot Cause/s -> Develop Alternative Solutions -> Select a Solution -> Implement Solution -> Evaluate Outcome

- Board Strategy Process
        Scan Environment -> Analyse Issues -> Identify Business Needs -> Set Strategy -> Oversee Execution

- Risk Management Process
        Identify Issue -> Analyse/Assess -> Identify Best Controls -> Assess Responsibility -> Monitor -> Assess Outcomes

- Management Decision Process
        Identify Issue -> Analyse Factors/Causes -> Diagnose Key/Problem/Opportunity -> Scope and Assign ... -> Supervise Execution -> Review Outcomes

- Health Treatment Process
       Take Patient History -> Examine Patient -> Diagnose Treatment -> Treat -> Review Outcomes

- Design Process
        Identify Problem -> Brainstorm -> Design -> build... -> Share Solution
