# Grace
	  seemingly effortless beauty
	  charm of movement, form, proportion.
	  affedi(li)ş, asalet, nezaket, çekicilik, ağırbaşlılık
	1. güzellik, zerafet, asalet
	2. lütuf
	3. şükran duası
	4. mühlet, süre (jeff buckley song)
	5. süslemek, donatmak
	6. şereflendirmek
fall from Grace


true love is a big deal
you have to be odd to be number one
depend on your walking stick, not on other people
pride comes before the fall, Stay Humble
by getting angry you show you are wrong
anyone who can make you angry, becomes your master
a polite devil is more agreeable than a rude saint
he will come to us like the rain
# Joy - gladness not based on circumstance.
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
night is the mother of advice
he who has not obeyed, cannot command.
a coward has no scar
when the mouse laughs at the cat, there is a hole nearby
vision without execution is just hallucination
when money speaks, no one checks the grammar.
a trader looks for consistency, a gambler looks for a quick profit
		   tutarlılık
		   kıvam
		   uyum
money is a good servant but a bad master
seek responsibility, not happiness
an excess of courtesy is discourtesy - aşırı nezaket nezaketsizliktir
nobody who ever gave their best regretted it - Elinden gelenin en iyisini yapan hiç kimse bundan pişman olmadı
you are entirely up to you
FEAR
	forget everything and run	destructive
