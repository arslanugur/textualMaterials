# Lesson 2: Mastering Your Mindset

--> What's Covered
    • The Importance of Mastering Your Mindset
        We are working towards results, but how are results created?
                Thoughts ---> Feeling ---> Action ---> Result
                                      ---> Relentless/Nonstop Action

    • Defining Your Why and Your Success
        What does being successful mean to you?
            - Financial Freedom?
            - Time Freedom
            - Achieving personal goals?
        Why do you want to succeed?
            - Why are you doing this?
            - Work Ethic matters

    • The Potential of YouTube Automation
        Good, Bad, Ugly Situations on Youtube
        Revenue, Profit.. per month
        Not overnight..
        Not a side business..

    • Reasons Why People Fail
        • The only reason you may still fail even though I give you the full YouTube automation blueprint is if you're unwilling to upgrade your thinking
            o 90% of your results will come from HOW YOU THINK not what you do
        • You can't get somewhere NEW with OLD ways of thinking and doing things
        • To achieve a goal you've never had, you must become someone you've never been
        • The only way to achieve a big goal is to level your mindset and become a better version of yourself
    • How to Become the New You?
        • Let go of old thinking, old beliefs, old fears and old perspectives
            o Let go of the limiting beliefs your parent told you when you were growing up
            o Let go of the old perspectives that are not serving you
        • Do not let somebody that is unqualified or with no results give you some suggestion and you take it as a fact
            o Be careful of the people who are making you feel small
        • Distance yourself from people who are negative
        • Remove the word "Problem" from your vocabulary, and replace it with "Challenge"
    • My Promises to You
        • YouTube is a long term game and not a get rich quick scheme
            o You're going to feel lost, confused, and demotivated at times
        • YouTube takes hard work, dedication, and perseverance
        • If you stick to it and stay persistent, one day your channel will get picked up
            o You are only one video away from blowing up
            o All the effort you put in will be worth it
        • YouTube is a business that is not linear like a stable job
            o The growth is exponential
            o Most people give up before their work shows results
            o  Don't be ones of those people..

    • Summary
        • Master your mindset because your thoughts and your beliefs are the starting point of your results
        • Defining your goals and your "Why" will give you the reasons for your actions 
        • Let go of your old limiting beliefs
        • YouTube is a long term game and we will be here with you every step of the way
