# Lesson 2: Video Ideas Part 3: Social Hacking Video Ideas

	• How to Come Up with Video Ideas
		- Social Hacking
			What's hot right now in Social Media?
			Social Hacking is all about analyzing and searching the web to understand what things are trending at the moment of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and more.

		- Know your audience
			What is your niche?
				- Niche Examples:
					New up-and-coming tech.
					Football channel that primarily covers football news and drama.
					Film channel that covers all the hidden gems of Disney shows.
			What does your current audience like to watch?
		- Be up-to-date with what is going on with the world.
			You can look at the daily news.				daily search trends by countries... Google Trends
			You can go on all different types of social media.
			You can follow big name profiles that post daily.
			You can follow major accounts that post updates related to the niche that you are in.
				trending topics can be used for your niche..
		- Relevance is Important
			Not all trends are built the same
			A trending topic about Spiderman has no relevance to a History channel
				How can we combine them history of Spiderman?
			The trending topics that you are finding must be integratable with the type of channel you have.
			Some examples of trending topics today are niches that benefit celebrity, lifestyle, law and justice channels, celebrity drama, NFL, stories explained channels
		- Social Hacking: Pros and Cons
			Social hacking tends to work better with 'Face' channels rather than with 'Faceless' channels.
			With 'Face' channels the center of attention is the person and the idea, which makes it easier to cover more trends because the focus is on them and the video idea.

			With 'Face' channels the center of attention is the subject and not the person.
			People are watching our videos because the idea seems interesting, not because we seem interesting.
			That limits us to trends that are related to our audience.

--> What's Covered
	• Importance of Having an Optimized YouTube Channel
		Many  channels on yt don't have their backend set up correctly yet they are still able to pick up traction and go viral
			Imagine if these channels are actually optimized?

		We are going set up our yt channels the right way and not leave anything on the table
		An optimized channel will help your channel:
			1. Get ranked in yt's search engine.
			2. Get promoted in yt  browse features.
			3. Get promoted in yt suggested features.
			4. Sets the foundation for hyper growth.

	• What are Keywords?
		Keywords: Words or Phrases that give yt context about your video and channel
			They help yt understand the type of context you produce and who your target audience is
			Ex: If the keywords of a channel are - SpaceX, NASA, and Blue Origin
			The algorithm would promote the video to people who enjoy watching space exploration videos.
	• What is SEO?
		Search Engine Optimization(SEO): a process of optimizing your videos and channel to increase its rankings on Google/YouTube's search engine
		Your goal is to rank the highest for specific keywords and phrases 
			This will allow your videos to appear in the first page of search
		The keywords and phrases allows us to target a specific demografic of searchers who might be interested in watching your videos.
			This allows your videos to gain more visibility leading to more viewership on your videos
		Optimized SEO for your videos will provide evergreen views because your videos will appear whenever people search up that specific keyword or phrase.
			Evergreen viewership will help with generating consistent income on YouTube.

		Both keywords and metadata help yt understand the type of content you produce and who your target audience is.

	• What is Metadata?
		Metadata: The keywords in your title, description, and tags for both videos and channel.
			Think of keywords as limbs of a body and the metadata as a whole functioning body.
		Similar to keywords, metadata help boost your videos and channel to your target audience.
		However, just having Metadata is not enough
			We need have "similar metadata" throughout our videos and channel
		Similar Metadata: Having the same keywords repeat throughout our videos and channel
			This is vital because it helps our videos get suggested to other videos on our channel	
			This causes a positive viewer feedback loop leading to a viewer watching more videos on your channel
		Similar Metadata with your competitors also helps our videos get suggested next to their videos
			This helps us "steal" their viewers
			This is the secret to going viral on YouTube

	Summary
		Similar metadata across your videos and channel causes a positive viewer feedback loop which is the secret sauce to going viral.
		Similar metadata will help your videos get sugggested next to your competitor's videos
		Never worry about competitor because we can "steal" their views with similar metadata.
			The better our competitors are doing, the better we will be doing.
