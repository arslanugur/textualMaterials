	• Synergize Titles and Thumbnails
	• What to Avoid When Creating Titles and Thumbnails

	
	• The Importance of Having a High-Quality Thumbnail and Title
		NOTE: Don't cut corners when coming up with a high-quality title and thumbnail

		Titles and Thumbnails are two vital aspects of a video that creators often spend too little time on
		A good title and thumbnail get people to click on your video to watch
			If people don't click on the video.. an amazing script, narration, and edit would be pointless..
		Titles and Thumbnails are CRUCIAL.
		Spending more time to be creative with my titles and thumbnails has been one of the reasons why I've had so much success on YouTube.


	• How to Write an Engaging Title
		Video ideas are NOT titles!
			video ideas are what the video about
			video titles can vary and the main purpose is to get clicks
		Title = Clickbait + Video Idea
		Put yourself into the shoes of your target audience
			"Would I click on this video because of this title?"
		Titles should be 70 characters or less
			if it's longer than that, it will automatically get cut off
		How to come up with a good video title?
			take inspiration from your competitors' viral videos
			does the title spark curiosity?
			does the title spark a question in the viewer's mind?
			does the viewer know what is the video about based on the title?


		idea				title (for clickbait)
		-----------------------------------------------------------------
		abandoned mansions		mansions no one wants for even $1
		SpaceX starship			what's inside the SpaceX starship? 
		bna				NBA players that FORCED rule changes
		dinosaurs			what happened the first minutes after the dinosaurs disappeared?
		whales				what to do if you are swallowed by a giant whale?


		bad idea				good idea
		--------------------------------------------------------------------
		top 10 fastest car			FASTEST cars you didnt know existed
		why do the rich invest in art?		fine art: the world's most secret tax scam
		watermelon juice can cleanse you	watermelon juice secrets that can change your life
		top 10 MMA weight cuts			strangest MMA weight cuts tactics
		how to pick up girls			5 tricks to confidently flirt with woman


		Always write 3-5 titles/variations for your videos until you get one that looks best.
			Example:
				1. Fastest Cars					so simple, not even title
				2. Fastest Supercars				no enough
				3. Fastest Cars in the WORLD!			why, is there any cars in the MARS?
				4. Fastest Cars that EVER existed		ever!?
				5. FASTEST Supercars You Never Knew Existed	okay, duh, sparking my curiosity...


	• How to Craft a High CTR Thumbnail
		the basis for creating thumbnails is to see which thumbnails have already been proven to work for your video idea
		how to find these already successful thumbnails?
			1. search your video idea on YouTube
			2. take note of the top 10 search results
				these thumbnails are proven to work
				find common themes or traits between the thumbnails
			3. put yourself into the audience's shoes
			4. "which aspects should I use in my thumbnail that would get me to click on my own video?"

		colour:	increase vibrance and sharpen the image when creating the thumbnail because our eyes naturally draw towards bright and colorful things.
		text:	dont place text on the bottom right because it has the timestamp of the video
				the timestamp will block anything you have there
			text should not be your title
			text needs to be big, bold, and readable
			maximum of 3 words on the thumbnail
		emotion: good thumbnails use strong emotions such as pain, love, hate, shock, and fear (example: mr. beast)
			 people connect with emotions
		using arrow and circle:
			use arrows or circle to make a part of the thumbnail stand out.
			increase engagement/attractiveness of the thumbnail (useful to point sth)

	• Synergize Titles and Thumbnails
		avoid repeating the same words in title and thumbnail
		create a story with title + thumbnail * * * 

		https://thumbsup.tv/
		how your thumbnail and title look on the youtube platform
		
	• What to Avoid When Creating Titles and Thumbnails
		youtube videos are less likely to be recommended to new viewers if the titles and thumbnails are:
			1. misleading
			2. promotes violence or abuse
			3. sexually suggestive or nudity
			4. contains cırse words

	Summary
		titles and thumbnails are crucial so you should spend more time making it the best you can!
			if people dont click on the video... an amazing script, narration, and edit would be pointless!
		title = clickbait + video idea
		to craft enticing titles and thumbnails, take inspiration from what is already working
			put yourself in the audience shoes
				"would I click on this video beacuse of this title and thumbnail?"
		for the thumbnail:
			dial up the colours
			have strategic text placement
			include arrow or circle to increase engagement
			include strong emotions
			invoke curiosity
		avoid titles and thumbnails that are misleading, show violence, show nudity, or curse words


Part 2
--> What's Covered
	• Making clickable titles
		Your Title is in the top 3 of most important things to make a YT Video
			so with that being said you should be spending lots of time with coming up with titles for your videos that way people will want to click

		When people look at your title and thumbnail here is what they think

		Is This Video What I am Looking for?
		Do I really want to watch this video?
		Is this video going to be woth my time?

		These questions are what subconsciously what uur viewer is thinking in the 1-2 seconds they spends looking at your title, so we need to make sure we deliver on that.

		These are the things your titles need to be but, I will break this down more for you 

			Titles need to be
				simple & short (Take out unnecessary words and get to the point)
				easy to understand (That way your niece and ur grandmother can understand)
				easy to remember (like a good song)
			The more universal The title the broader the potential audience

		Your title needs to fulfill the why and the what for viewers

		With looking a these charts you can identify a couple of things, people come to youtube for
			1. education (learn a specific thing)
			2. relaxation
			3. entertainment
			4. relate with community
			5. inspiration
			6. curiosity (learn sth new) DIY

		now that we know why people are hoping onto yt we need to know the WHAT
			what would they find entertaining
			what do they wan to learn
			what destress' them
			what do they want/need to learn
			what makes them feel connected too community
