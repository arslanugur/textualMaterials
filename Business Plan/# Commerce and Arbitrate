  # Kurulduğundaki dönem
    .com krizi dönemi --> amazon bile neredeyse batıyormuş
    TR ekonomik kriz  --> Yazar kasa atılıyor..
    ilk kurulduğunda 5-6 sene kar bile edemiyor...
    yanlış zamanda kurulmuş ama "firstmover" olduğu için hayatta kalabilmiş --> vazgeçememk için bir neden aslında 
    European Founders Fund - İlk yatırım
    2010 yılından sonra online alışveriş dalgası başlıyor.
    900bin üye, 30bin sipariş daily order
    
    General Atlantic - ikinci yatırım.. 44M$
    
    Diğer Pazarlara giriliyor...
        Qatar, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia
        Yunanistan ClickDelivery'i satın alıyor..
        Russia'da barınamadı...
    
    Yemek.com
        Yemek bloğu, portalı, reçeteler, tarifler...
        --> Yaptıkları işin türevini oluşturup müşteri çekme stratjisi.

    Deliveryhero, Yemeksepetini satın alıyor..
        Yemeksepetinin rekorunu çinlilere satılan trendyol kırıyor...
        Trendyolun rekorunu da Zynga'ya satılan Peak Games kırdı..
    
    İşin tuhafı, DeliveryHero yemeksepetinden 10 yıl sonra kurulmuş
        Ve aynı sektörde faaliyet gösteriyorlar
        bu yüzden hangi işi yaparsan yap GLOBALi düşün
        Yemeksepeti 2000 yılında kurulmuş
        Deliveryhero 2010 yılında kurulmuş
          Nevzat Aydın:
          bir türk şirketi olmanın bazen handicapları olabilir
          dünyadan yatırım almak ya da nasıl alacağını bilmek durumu zora sokabiliyor..
          eğer ki 2008 yılında daha fazla yatırım alabilselerdi
          3-4M$lık şirket olabilirlerdi
          Ülkedeki ekonomik istikrar, ekonomik şeffaflık ne derece önemli olduğunu gösteriyor.
          yani şirketler satılmak yerine daha da dış pazarda büyüyebilirdi
          
      YemekSepeti Stats in 2023
          The most ordered Products: En çok satan ürünler
          Orders are the most increasing order: Artış oranı olarak artış gösteren ürünler
          Order Busy Day: Friday
          Peak Hours: 19:00-20:00
          Kullanıcılara sunulan indirim --> 395.000.000tl - ceplerinde kalmış
          Which restaurant order number per day: 1907 order record in İzmir
          The most ordering user - 1548 siparişi

      Aslında yapılan şey
          Kullanıcıların alışkanlıklarını değiştirmekti (User's Habits and Customer Behaviour) --> Apple şirketi gibi 
          Kullanıcı davranışlarını değiştirmek çok zordur aslında
              bu başarının getirisi limitsiz oluyor aslında....
