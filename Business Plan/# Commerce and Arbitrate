# Ways Only Billionaires Know: https://youtu.be/nV9AI0LM2Xw
01. You don't usually get to $1 Billion and still own 100% of your business
    Bezos owns 12.7% of Amazon
    Musk owns 13% of Tesla
    Arnault owns 46% of LVMH
    Buffett owns %16 of B. Hathaway
    Ellison owns 35% of Oracle
    Most millionaires are share protective
    15% in a multi-billion dollar pie > 100% of your 3M dollar business
    
02. Real-Estate will make you a millionaire, Private Equity makes you a billionaire
    --> Private Equity Funds - Özel Sermaye Fonları
    ÖSF genellikle halka açık olmayan şirketlere doğrudan sermaye yatırımı yapan fonlardır. 
    Ortaklar, çoğunlukla emekli sandıkları, sigorta şirketleri, vakıflar, şirketler ve bireylerdir.
    
    Real Estate - 35-50% tied up in real-estate
    Private Equity - 70% of their net worth
    
    Venture Capital nedir?
    Private Equity nedir?
    
    Own a Business, blow it up
    Truth is nobody gets rich being employed.
      You get rich by owning something that dramatically increases in value in a short period of time.
    
03. Don't use your own money, use someone else's to make yourself rich
    Scale Up Other People's Money
    Step1:  They go to friends, family, banks or angel investors with an idea and they're willing to do all the work to make it happen
            Start at $100k and give off 20% of the company for yourself. 
            Company valued at $500k
            80% worth $400k
    Step2:  They get some revenue and build a team ready to scale
            1M$ in recurring revenue per year
    Step3:  They then go to some external investors and sell 20% of the business at a 10M$ valuation
            2M$ Cash
            6M$ + 60% of the company
    Step4:  Use the 2M$ to go from 1 to 10M$ in yearly recurring revenue
    Step5:  You go to raise funds again this time at 100M$ valuation
            Sell 20% and get that $20M
            40% is worth $40M
    Step6:  You use the 20M to develop a product for other companies and hire sales people
    Step7:  You file for an IPO, where the company floats 10% of its shares on the public market at a 10B$ valuation
            Iniatial Public Offer (IPO) - İlk Halka Arz
            
04. Everything is a buy low - sell high equation, only the scale differs
    Trader Way
    Step1: What is your mark-up
    Step2: What is your scale (a number of transactions youre able to do)
           Amazon as an e-commerce store has tiny margins but a lot of transactions
    
    A Business grows when one of three situations:
      - You charge more and maintain the same number of transactions. (Artists use this model)
      - You charge the same but increase the number of customers. (When Fast-Food Chain open up new location)
      - You charge more while increasing the number of transactions. (Luxury Brands use this strategy)

    "The Profit is made at the point of purchase, not the point of sale... " the POP * * *

05. Art is a preferred store of value that cam easily be moved around
    Sotheby's, Christie's
    Fine Arts
    62% of ultra-high-net-worth investors allocate 30%
    https://www.masterworks.com/
    "When stock markets take a nosedive, people look to invest in art. it's more tangible. The art market is bulletproof" Benrimon
    https://www.alux.com/
    
06. Stocks won't get you to a billion, neither will luck
    Financial models like Dividends tell a fancy tale...
    Buffett paid $31,500 for a house in 1958
        Market value now --> $877,000 for the same house...
        
07. Every new billionaire turns other millionaires into billionaires
    Scale Up Other People's Money
    Peter Thiel - invests Meta - 500k$ in exchange for 10.2 percent of Meta
                  When Meta IPOed, he sold two-thirds (2/3) of his shares for $628M
    Garry Tan - Venture Capitalist.
                  Y Combinator..
                  invest in Coinbase in 2013, $300k --> worth $2.4B
    Make your money and use it for promising businesses
    
08. Less than 5% of their worth is liquid

    "You don't pay tax on debt..."
    Smart people would rather borrow that money using their assets as collateral...

    """
    When Musk bought Twitter, 
    He didnt actually sell his shares in Tesla or SpaceX in ordweer to come up with that money
    The Bank gave him the funds to buy Twitter
    """
    
    
09. The real money is made in a crisis
    B. Hathaway was underperforiming for the past 10 years
                    losing 1-3% per year
                    buying at 50-75% discounts
    
    Recession is like Black Friday for Rich people
    Everything you really want is on sale..
    
10. They all had and still have experts minimizing risk and increasing returns
                                        "riski aza indiren ve geliri arttıran.."
    Executive Coaches
    
    Over 60% of respondents say that they have already crushed their main goal after 1 year of using the app --> Alux: Self-Help & Productivity
    Another 30% saying they're closing in fast.
    
11. Very few billionaires are direct-to-customer, most of the money is in Enterprise
    Amazon's Cloud Infrastructure Business --> AWS prints cash... 
    Annual revenue of AWS increased by year...
    Amazon actually lose money in direct-to-customer.
    Google Cloud revenue soars past $6 Billion
    
12. Most Billionaires don't start from the bottom
    Elon Musk's Dad, Bill Gates' Mum, Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250k
    
13. Most industry tycoons get wealthy by exporting slave labour where you can't see it - and the world doesn't really care
    Almost all electronic appliances use cobalt.. Congo...
    Less than $2 per day...
    Child Workforce
    Fast Fashion ... Cheaply Work Force

14. Almost all are sociopathically obsessed with money and success
    Hyper-Competitive
    Never Give up..
    "Life will grant you one wish, but you have to figure out what is it , and be absolutely obsessed with one wish non-stop for decades."
    
15. "Decision Making & Persuasion" are the only two Billionaire-Tier skills
    Decision Making: High Level Decisions
      Systematically improve your decision making process
    Persuasion: Sales and Clear Communication


# CHEAT CODES: https://youtu.be/JoB3wL15edA 16:00
# If life is a simulation, self-confidence is a cheat code...
# Where you live is the most important decision you will make in your life.
# If you want to flourish you take care of the "soil", not of the seed
                                               market             product
                                               traffic            place
                                               environment
# A flower doesn't go after the bee
  The flower flourishes and then the bee comes..
  True love and friends both come naturally..
# Reality is negotiable
# If your dog starts barking at you, someone else is feeding it.. This isn't really about dogs...  
# You are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with..
# A sinking ship can save noone. If you want to live a life that matters, start with yourself
# You solve boredom by being curious
# Once you figure yourself out stay in your lane and leave them be
  Seek progress, not perfection
  Good enough now is better than perfect never.
# Direction is more important than speed. The same way hard work won't get you very far if the idea is poor  
# BETTER > MORE > NEW
  Shiny objects/traps are all around you..
# You don't win by being better, you win by doing the things others don't consider valuable.
# Great is just good repeated over and over again.
  Consistency beats talent when talent isn't consistency.
# You have to choose one of two pains: Pain of disciple or Pain of regret...
# The gap between reality and expectations creates stress..
# You might not realize it, but 1% and 2% the difference is 100%
# The only free cheese is in the mousetrap
# You should never be stupidier than you need to be..
# Be careful of unearned money or knowledge.. There's usually a price to pay
  The lottery is like a special tax for people who can't do math...
# Venture out into the unknown.
  Every day do one thing that gets you closer to your big goal.
  Boats are safe in the harbor
# Measure in decades not days. You will be paid based on your ability to see into the future. 
# Never assume the answer is No, before you ask.  let them be the ones to tell you No
# A man with no aspirations sees dreams as arrogance..
# Learn to use leverage. Those who the tools are their disposal outperform the rest

        --> Yaptıkları işin türevini oluşturup müşteri çekme stratjisi.

    Deliveryhero, Yemeksepetini satın alıyor..
        Yemeksepetinin rekorunu çinlilere satılan trendyol kırıyor...
        Trendyolun rekorunu da Zynga'ya satılan Peak Games kırdı..
    
    İşin tuhafı, DeliveryHero yemeksepetinden 10 yıl sonra kurulmuş
        Ve aynı sektörde faaliyet gösteriyorlar
        bu yüzden hangi işi yaparsan yap GLOBALi düşün
        Yemeksepeti 2000 yılında kurulmuş
        Deliveryhero 2010 yılında kurulmuş
          Nevzat Aydın:
          bir türk şirketi olmanın bazen handicapları olabilir
          dünyadan yatırım almak ya da nasıl alacağını bilmek durumu zora sokabiliyor..
          eğer ki 2008 yılında daha fazla yatırım alabilselerdi
          3-4M$lık şirket olabilirlerdi
          Ülkedeki ekonomik istikrar, ekonomik şeffaflık ne derece önemli olduğunu gösteriyor.
          yani şirketler satılmak yerine daha da dış pazarda büyüyebilirdi

      Aslında yapılan şey
          Kullanıcıların alışkanlıklarını değiştirmekti (User's Habits and Customer Behaviour) --> Apple şirketi gibi 
          Kullanıcı davranışlarını değiştirmek çok zordur aslında
              bu başarının getirisi limitsiz oluyor aslında....
              
          Amazonda satıcı olarak da bunu öğrenmek için çalışıyoruz --> Special Days and Users Habits.
