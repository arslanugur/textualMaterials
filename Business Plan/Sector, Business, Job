  WANTS are things we would like to have but donâ€™t need to survive. 
  These include luxuries such as mobile phones or holidays.
  For a business to survive, it needs to satisfy the needs and wants of the consumer. 
  Business can satisfy needs and wants by providing goods and services to the consumer.

  GOODS are products that you can see and touch (tangible) such as laptops, clothes or food.
  
  SERVICES are products that you cannot hold or touch (intangible) such as public transport, a haircut or a visit to the cinema.
  For a business to be able to provide goods and services it will need to combine a variety of resources.

# Sectors
- Primary
  The primary sector of industry is concerned with the extraction of raw materials or natural resources from the land.
  Any business that grows goods or extracts materials from the land would be classed as a primary sector business.
  Examples of businesses that operate in the primary sector would be 
      farming, mining, fishing or oil production.

  However, the primary sector is often associated with environmental concerns, 
    such as deforestation, overfishing, and pollution from mining and oil extraction. 
  Thus, sustainable management practices are increasingly being adopted in the primary sector to address these concerns and ensure the long-term viability of these industries.

  Forestry
  Fishery

  Mining
    Coal Mining
  Natural resource

- Secondary
  The secondary sector of industry is concerned with manufacturing. 
  This would involve taking the raw materials from the primary sector and converting them into new products.
  Examples of businesses that operate in the secondary sector would be
