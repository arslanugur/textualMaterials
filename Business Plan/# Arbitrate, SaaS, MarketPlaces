    TR ekonomik kriz  --> Yazar kasa atılıyor..
    ilk kurulduğunda 5-6 sene kar bile edemiyor...
    yanlış zamanda kurulmuş ama "firstmover" olduğu için hayatta kalabilmiş --> vazgeçememk için bir neden aslında 
    European Founders Fund - İlk yatırım
    2010 yılından sonra online alışveriş dalgası başlıyor.
    900bin üye, 30bin sipariş daily order

        --> Yaptıkları işin türevini oluşturup müşteri çekme stratjisi.

    Deliveryhero, Yemeksepetini satın alıyor..
        Yemeksepetinin rekorunu çinlilere satılan trendyol kırıyor...
        Trendyolun rekorunu da Zynga'ya satılan Peak Games kırdı..
    
    İşin tuhafı, DeliveryHero yemeksepetinden 10 yıl sonra kurulmuş
        Ve aynı sektörde faaliyet gösteriyorlar
        bu yüzden hangi işi yaparsan yap GLOBALi düşün
        Yemeksepeti 2000 yılında kurulmuş
        Deliveryhero 2010 yılında kurulmuş
          Nevzat Aydın:
          bir türk şirketi olmanın bazen handicapları olabilir
          dünyadan yatırım almak ya da nasıl alacağını bilmek durumu zora sokabiliyor..
          eğer ki 2008 yılında daha fazla yatırım alabilselerdi
          3-4M$lık şirket olabilirlerdi
          Ülkedeki ekonomik istikrar, ekonomik şeffaflık ne derece önemli olduğunu gösteriyor.

# Ways Only Billionaires Know: https://youtu.be/nV9AI0LM2Xw
01. You don't usually get to $1 Billion and still own 100% of your business
    Bezos owns 12.7% of Amazon
    Musk owns 13% of Tesla
    Arnault owns 46% of LVMH
    Buffett owns %16 of B. Hathaway
    Ellison owns 35% of Oracle
    Most millionaires are share protective
    15% in a multi-billion dollar pie > 100% of your 3M dollar business
    
02. Real-Estate will make you a millionaire, Private Equity makes you a billionaire
    --> Private Equity Funds - Özel Sermaye Fonları
    ÖSF genellikle halka açık olmayan şirketlere doğrudan sermaye yatırımı yapan fonlardır. 
    Ortaklar, çoğunlukla emekli sandıkları, sigorta şirketleri, vakıflar, şirketler ve bireylerdir.
    
    Real Estate - 35-50% tied up in real-estate
    Private Equity - 70% of their net worth
    
    Venture Capital nedir?
    Private Equity nedir?
    
    Own a Business, blow it up
    Truth is nobody gets rich being employed.
      You get rich by owning something that dramatically increases in value in a short period of time.
    
03. Don't use your own money, use someone else's to make yourself rich
    Scale Up Other People's Money
    Step1:  They go to friends, family, banks or angel investors with an idea and they're willing to do all the work to make it happen
            Start at $100k and give off 20% of the company for yourself. 
            Company valued at $500k
            80% worth $400k
    Step2:  They get some revenue and build a team ready to scale
            1M$ in recurring revenue per year
    Step3:  They then go to some external investors and sell 20% of the business at a 10M$ valuation
            2M$ Cash
            6M$ + 60% of the company
    Step4:  Use the 2M$ to go from 1 to 10M$ in yearly recurring revenue
    Step5:  You go to raise funds again this time at 100M$ valuation
            Sell 20% and get that $20M
            40% is worth $40M
    Step6:  You use the 20M to develop a product for other companies and hire sales people
    Step7:  You file for an IPO, where the company floats 10% of its shares on the public market at a 10B$ valuation
            Iniatial Public Offer (IPO) - İlk Halka Arz
            
04. Everything is a buy low - sell high equation, only the scale differs
    Trader Way
    Step1: What is your mark-up
    Step2: What is your scale (a number of transactions youre able to do)
           Amazon as an e-commerce store has tiny margins but a lot of transactions
    
    A Business grows when one of three situations:
      - You charge more and maintain the same number of transactions. (Artists use this model)
      - You charge the same but increase the number of customers. (When Fast-Food Chain open up new location)
      - You charge more while increasing the number of transactions. (Luxury Brands use this strategy) * * * * * 

    "The Profit is made at the point of purchase, not the point of sale... " the POP * * *

05. Art is a preferred store of value that cam easily be moved around
    Sotheby's, Christie's
    Fine Arts
    62% of ultra-high-net-worth investors allocate 30%
    https://www.masterworks.com/
    "When stock markets take a nosedive, people look to invest in art. it's more tangible. The art market is bulletproof" Benrimon
    https://www.alux.com/
    
06. Stocks won't get you to a billion, neither will luck
    Financial models like Dividends tell a fancy tale...
    Buffett paid $31,500 for a house in 1958
        Market value now --> $877,000 for the same house...
        
07. Every new billionaire turns other millionaires into billionaires
    Scale Up Other People's Money
    Peter Thiel - invests Meta - 500k$ in exchange for 10.2 percent of Meta
                  When Meta IPOed, he sold two-thirds (2/3) of his shares for $628M
    Garry Tan - Venture Capitalist.
                  Y Combinator..
                  invest in Coinbase in 2013, $300k --> worth $2.4B
    Make your money and use it for promising businesses
    
08. Less than 5% of their worth is liquid

    "You don't pay tax on debt..."
    Smart people would rather borrow that money using their assets as collateral...

    """
    When Musk bought Twitter, 
    He didnt actually sell his shares in Tesla or SpaceX in ordweer to come up with that money
    The Bank gave him the funds to buy Twitter
    """
    
    
09. The real money is made in a crisis
    B. Hathaway was underperforiming for the past 10 years
                    losing 1-3% per year
                    buying at 50-75% discounts
    
    Recession is like Black Friday for Rich people
    Everything you really want is on sale..
    
10. They all had and still have experts minimizing risk and increasing returns
                                        "riski aza indiren ve geliri arttıran.."
    Executive Coaches
    
    Over 60% of respondents say that they have already crushed their main goal after 1 year of using the app --> Alux: Self-Help & Productivity
    Another 30% saying they're closing in fast.
    
11. Very few billionaires are direct-to-customer, most of the money is in Enterprise
    Amazon's Cloud Infrastructure Business --> AWS prints cash... 
    Annual revenue of AWS increased by year...
    Amazon actually lose money in direct-to-customer.
    Google Cloud revenue soars past $6 Billion
    
12. Most Billionaires don't start from the bottom
    Elon Musk's Dad, Bill Gates' Mum, Jeff Bezos' parents gave him $250k
    
13. Most industry tycoons get wealthy by exporting slave labour where you can't see it - and the world doesn't really care
    Almost all electronic appliances use cobalt.. Congo...
    Less than $2 per day...
    Child Workforce
    Fast Fashion ... Cheaply Work Force

14. Almost all are sociopathically obsessed with money and success
    Hyper-Competitive
    Never Give up..
    "Life will grant you one wish, but you have to figure out what is it , and be absolutely obsessed with one wish non-stop for decades."
    
15. "Decision Making & Persuasion" are the only two Billionaire-Tier skills
    Decision Making: High Level Decisions
      Systematically improve your decision making process
    Persuasion: Sales and Clear Communication


# CHEAT CODES: https://youtu.be/JoB3wL15edA 16:00
# If life is a simulation, self-confidence is a cheat code...
# Where you live is the most important decision you will make in your life.
# If you want to flourish you take care of the "soil", not of the seed

# A flower doesn't go after the bee
  The flower flourishes and then the bee comes..
  True love and friends both come naturally..
# Reality is negotiable
# If your dog starts barking at you, someone else is feeding it.. This isn't really about dogs...  
# You are the average of the five people you spend most of your time with..
# A sinking ship can save noone. If you want to live a life that matters, start with yourself
# You solve boredom by being curious
# Once you figure yourself out stay in your lane and leave them be
  Seek progress, not perfection
  Good enough now is better than perfect never.
# Direction is more important than speed. The same way hard work won't get you very far if the idea is poor  
# BETTER > MORE > NEW
  Shiny objects/traps are all around you..
# You don't win by being better, you win by doing the things others don't consider valuable.
# Great is just good repeated over and over again.
  Consistency beats talent when talent isn't consistency.

# The gap between reality and expectations creates stress..
# You might not realize it, but 1% and 2% the difference is 100%
# The only free cheese is in the mousetrap
# You should never be stupidier than you need to be..
# Be careful of unearned money or knowledge.. There's usually a price to pay
  The lottery is like a special tax for people who can't do math...
# Venture out into the unknown.
  Every day do one thing that gets you closer to your big goal.
  Boats are safe in the harbor
# Measure in decades not days. You will be paid based on your ability to see into the future. 
# Never assume the answer is No, before you ask.  let them be the ones to tell you No
# A man with no aspirations sees dreams as arrogance..
# Learn to use leverage. Those who the tools are their disposal outperform the rest

# 15 things the poor dont know about making money
01- You can pay little to no money in tax, if you start a business
  Business dont pay taxes on income they pay taxes on what's left after you subtract expenses
    Money is able to generate
    Revenue - Expenses = 0  You will not pay any taxes at all

          Individuals earns money                                   Business makes money
              gets taxed on that money                                       spends money
              spends what's left                                        then gets taxed on what's left
  
  The Average American pays somewhere around %27 income tax, while in Europe is closer to %50

02- Making money is about system solving, not hard working
  The value comes from your ability to create a chain system that transform input into money
    Someone earns money by being the salesperson at a lemonade stand.
      The owner of the stand is paying him by the hour
      - The owner of the stand identify the product/service: Lemonade
      - You have the stand where the lemonade gets sold at
      - the person who is selling the lemonade
      - transport of the ingradients to the lemon stand
      - the actual ingredients that need to be purchased from what is called a supplier

        Supplier ---> Distribution ---> Processing ---> Sales ---> Consumer

03- make money while u sleep or u will never be rich
    as long as youre trading time for money, u will never be rich
    dont be the machine that makes money, build the machine that makes money for you
    
04- It takes the same amount of effort to make $50k or $1m
    if you are earning $2000 a month selling Telekom subscriptions over the phone
      you can earn over $20.000 a month by selling cars or real estate
      you can earn over $100k a month by selling stocks on wall street
      process is the similar but reward is greater 
      
05- Ideas are worthless without "extended execution"
    an idea is a multiplier to your execution
    execution * idea = result
        0 * idea = 0
        execution * 0.1 = .. --> any mediocre idea and simply execute better on it
        success comes from being able to execute at a high level for extended periods of time
          making coffee with milk isnt a billion dollar idea but starbucks..
          yüzyıllardan beri kahve yapııyor neden starbucks olduğu bu şekilde  anlaşılıyor...
          
06- Instead of cutting down costs, focus on increasing income
    for coupon- why you wasting 2 hours of your life  driving to different markets just to save $10 on some stuff
      the return on your time is wack
    do something to find a different job instead...
    
07- $100 in passive income is worth more than $1000 of worked income
    that 1000$ is dependant on u being able to show up, to perform, to secure clients etc. while 100$ isnt
    ...
    $40k per year in passive income is worth more than $200k of worked income a year job
    passive income revenue is multiplied in value by the time it frees up
    5 days per week * 10 hours freed up = 50hours freed up per week
    
08- over 50% of your income should go towards investments
    freedom money
    lifestyle cost?
    in order to be free, your passive income needs to be at least double that of the lifestylecost
    in order to be free, your active income needs to be at least five times the lifestylecost

    1 learn new skills that immediately improve your market value
    2 start to build a system that doesnt rely on you to earn money, on the side
    3 when the new money starts coming in, switch to side project full time
    4 reinvest everything in the business while living below your means
    5 when the real money comes in, move it to altern investments

09- $1m per year isnt a lot of money
    money is getting devalued every single year
    $1.75t notes in circulation in 2020
    FED decided to print another 2.3t$
    "Value comes from scarcity"
    this devaluation of currency is called inflation
    $1m per year in 2020 is roughly the equivalent of 250k$ just 30 years ago, not just because of inflation, but also the buying power
    real-estate is a great barometer of this.....
    
10- a wall gets builts brick by brick, same is wealth
    the rich never buy lottery tickets...
    robinhood, revolut, etoro
    dividend stocks to store value...
    money:master the game by tony robbins
    rich dad poor dad by robert kyiosaki
    the millionaire fastlane by mj. demarco
    your life is cheap, cause you think investing yurself is expensive
 
 11- never borrow money that doesnt go towards making more money ...
      moneyshop-one of the biggest payday lenders in the uk
        charges £30 to borrow £100 for a month
      wonga charges £37.15 to borrow £100 fora month 
 
      the moment youre giving your money to someone else, youre making that person richer and making urself poorer
      
12- you earn in proportion to your ability to use the tools you have at your disposal
    people no longer understand the purpose of tools...
    why do you have $1000 iphone to only scroll instaram
    iphone is a tool or instagram or youtube..
    tools are multipliers and the amazing thing is that they stick up onto each other
    poor purchase things for status, rich purchase them for purpose
    
    learn to monetize the things you already have
    
13- keeping money is harder than making money.....
    bu yüzden para birikmiyor....
    making money is one of the easiest things in the world
      but not losing it is actualy very difficult if you dont know what youre doing
      
14- business-people hire good-prpfessionals to make them rich
      poor people are looking for security
      rich people are looking to build wealth
      the harder you are to replace, the more you are worth to the marketplace
      the rich dont think in terms of salary, they think in terms of profit
      
15- you need at least 3 income streams to feel safe
    revenue from where...

You live in the abundant period şn human history
Money follows attention.... Advertising, Fame, Community
