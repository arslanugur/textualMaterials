dollar is biggest delusion in the history since 1971

# Fiat money is not real money
  Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not directly convertible to a commodity like gold or silver.
  but instead derives its value from trust and confidence that people have in the stability of the issuing gov policies and its economy.
  Central banks can control the supply of fiat money

# Money's Value
  How to safeguard your money?
The problem with money is that it doesnt hold its value in time unless invested.
Dont keep in the bank, keep investing
Cash is not a king anymore, but a king in negotiations
Saving will make you poor, Investing will make you wealthy

Investment will grow in time and alleviate the potential pain in your life
# Investments are made when there's blood on the streets
  Panic Times - Global Financial Crisis

Rich looks at cash the way we look at ice-cubes in a warm room.
Don't hold the cash in your hand for too long cause u might see it melt away

$1M per year isnt a lot of money
    money is getting devalued every single year
    $1.75t notes in circulation in 2020
    FED decided to print another 2.3t$
    "Value comes from scarcity"
    this devaluation of currency is called inflation
    $1m per year in 2020 is roughly the equivalent of 250k$ just 30 years ago, not just because of inflation, but also the buying power
    real-estate is a great barometer of this..

If you wanna get rich, own sth that increases in value over time..

# Retirement trap
  Retirement is not a gift for working hard for your entire life...
  Retirement is not an age, it's a number
                            So, You can hit your number at 30, 40, 50 ...
                            The number is 2X what your lifestyle costs, generated by your investments.
  
  If your lifestyle costs = $60,000 per year
                            food, gas, clothes, subscriptions etc.
                            $5,000 per month on average
              your number = $10,000 per month from passive income

# Investing Mistakes
    Decision Making, Ratio of Success
- Being emotional about money is a mistake
    Deal-flow - number of oportunities and investments
        the more deals you make the better your decision-making mechanism
        Having a strong deal-flow is important for investors or businesses looking to grow and make profitable investments or partnerships. 
        By having a large pool of potential opportunities to choose from, they can be more selective and choose the best options that align with their goals and values. 
        It can also give them an advantage in negotiating favorable terms or finding unique opportunities that may not be widely known.

        Deal-flow can come from a variety of sources, such as personal networks, industry events, online platforms, and other sources. 
        It's important to have a diverse and reliable set of sources to ensure a steady flow of high-quality opportunities.

- Trying to time the market is a mistake
    Dont buy bad assets...
    Time in the market beats timing the market.
    Think in decades instead of months...

- Short term bets, trades and short term thinking is a mistake
    Think longer about your investments..
    Think in decades instead of months...
    No Casino, No Gambling..
    
- Being cash poor is a mistake
    --> Difference between making money and building wealth
        the poor buy an assets with the hopes that they will be able to sell it at a later date for more than they paid for and thus make a profit.
        the wealthy buy assets with the intention of never selling them.
            buy income generating assets... a continuous accumulation..

- Putting all your eggs into one basket
    90% of your investments should be split based on your expertise, the rest is play money.
    75% business, 20% real-estate, 5% stocks..
    90% of your investments should go towards what you know.

- Spreading yourself too thin is a mistake

        - WRONG

        $100 in each one by expecting major moves or doubles in value in a short period....
        - RIGHT
        10 stocks you pick.. and long run..
        $1000 each
        Extra $1000 and your portfolio would go up by %10
        the more you know, the less you need to diversify...
        
        80% of our stock portfolio is just the S&P500
        the remaining 20% is just there for quick cash liquidity..
        
- Investing in sth just because X invested in it is a mistake
    you do not have the same agility of play as they do
    if you're walking in the footsteps of someone else, know that they already got the reward before you get there
    for most of people, money is emotional...

- Investing based on what's on the news, newsletters or forums, channels is a mistake.

- Investing in things they don't understand is a mistake
    distractions and shiny objects..
    if you cannot explain it end to end to someone else, you shouldn't invest..
    
- Failing to rebalance a personal portfolio is a mistake
    rebalance your investments...
    $100k distribution
        70% real estate             70k$ ---> 100k$
        25% stocks                  25k$ ---> 50k$

- Panic Selling is a mistake
