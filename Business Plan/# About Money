# Financial arbitrage... Not all money is the same
People in europe think in euro
People in russia think in ruble
People in us think in dollar
  They are accustomed to uni-directional thinking, but it is wrong...

Pros:
  $1M can buy a house in LA, but also $1M can buy a hotel in somewhere else...
  British go on holiday cheaply in Turkey

# the problem with money is that it doesnt hold its value in time unless invested.
dont keep in the bank, keep investing

rich looks at cash the way we look at ice-cubes in a warm room.
dont hold the cash in your hand for too long cause u might see it melt away
