🔻 How to get the first million

the first number you need to focus on is $274

    the formula which will give you your first six figures

so how do you make $274 a day?
    $5                          if you have a $5 product you need to sell at least 55 products per day
    $10                         if you have a $10 product you need to sell at least 28 products per day
    $20                         if you have a $20 product you need to sell at least 14 products per day

# Fiat money is not real money
  Fiat money is a government-issued currency that is not directly convertible to a commodity like gold or silver.

$1M per year isnt a lot of money
    money is getting devalued every single year
    $1.75t notes in circulation in 2020
    FED decided to print another 2.3t$
    "Value comes from scarcity"
    this devaluation of currency is called inflation
    $1m per year in 2020 is roughly the equivalent of 250k$ just 30 years ago, not just because of inflation, but also the buying power
    real-estate is a great barometer of this..

If you wanna get rich, own sth that increases in value over time..

# Retirement trap
  Retirement is not a gift for working hard for your entire life...
  Retirement is not an age, it's a number

                            The number is 2X what your lifestyle costs, generated by your investments.
  
  If your lifestyle costs = $60,000 per year
                            food, gas, clothes, subscriptions etc.
                            $5,000 per month on average

# Investing Mistakes
    Decision Making, Ratio of Success
- Being emotional about money is a mistake
    Deal-flow - number of oportunities and investments
        the more deals you make the better your decision-making mechanism
        Having a strong deal-flow is important for investors or businesses looking to grow and make profitable investments or partnerships. 
        By having a large pool of potential opportunities to choose from, they can be more selective and choose the best options that align with their goals and values. 
        It can also give them an advantage in negotiating favorable terms or finding unique opportunities that may not be widely known.

        Deal-flow can come from a variety of sources, such as personal networks, industry events, online platforms, and other sources. 
        It's important to have a diverse and reliable set of sources to ensure a steady flow of high-quality opportunities.

- Trying to time the market is a mistake
    Dont buy bad assets...
    Time in the market beats timing the market.
    Think in decades instead of months...

- Short term bets, trades and short term thinking is a mistake
    Think longer about your investments..
    Think in decades instead of months...
    No Casino, No Gambling..
    
- Being cash poor is a mistake
    --> Difference between making money and building wealth
        the poor buy an assets with the hopes that they will be able to sell it at a later date for more than they paid for and thus make a profit.
        the wealthy buy assets with the intention of never selling them.
            buy income generating assets... a continuous accumulation..

        - RIGHT
        10 stocks you pick.. and long run..
        $1000 each
        Extra $1000 and your portfolio would go up by %10
        the more you know, the less you need to diversify...
        
        80% of our stock portfolio is just the S&P500
        the remaining 20% is just there for quick cash liquidity..
        
- Investing in sth just because X invested in it is a mistake
    you do not have the same agility of play as they do
    if you're walking in the footsteps of someone else, know that they already got the reward before you get there
    for most of people, money is emotional...

- Investing based on what's on the news, newsletters or forums, channels is a mistake.

- Investing in things they don't understand is a mistake
    distractions and shiny objects..
    if you cannot explain it end to end to someone else, you shouldn't invest..
    
- Failing to rebalance a personal portfolio is a mistake
    rebalance your investments...
    $100k distribution
        70% real estate             70k$ ---> 100k$
        25% stocks                  25k$ ---> 50k$
        5% cryto or blue chip art   5k$ ---> 50k$ 10Xd
                                             200k$
                                             the total value of your portfolio has now jumped from 100k$ to 200k$
    Right rebalancing = 200k$ distribution
    $140k$ real-estate
    $50k stocks
    $10k crypto or art
                                             
- Panic Selling is a mistake
    is the promise the same?
    is the company still around?
    is it still profitable?
    
- Not taking out profits is a mistake
    nobody ever went broke taking profits..

- constantly checking your investments is a mistake
    time-wasting and anxiety-inducing
    
- Going YOLO is a mistake
- Thinking "this time is different" is a mistake
    once you get burnt, dont put your hand back in the fire
    
- money takes over your life
    dont let it..
    is it worth?

# Naval Ravikant Principles
1. Zamanını başkalarına satarak zengin olamazsın
    Emeğin karşılığında para kazanıyorsun.. Doktor vesairesin yine olmaz..
    Zenginlik değil, Refah olmalı, servet sahibi olmalısın.. Bu seni özgür yapar.
    Çalışmasan bile işleyecek bir sistem kurmalısın.
    Restaurant sahibi olmak önemli değil, o restaurant sensiz de işleyebilir mi bunun yolunu yap
    Siz çalışmazken de size para kazanduracak sistem/iş kur.
        Bir iş kur, bu işin de pek çok faktörünü başkalarına yaptır. Başkalarının emeğiyle bir kaldıraçtan yararlanacaksın. Yatırım yap..
2. Para kazanmak yapılan bir iş değil, öğrenilen bir beceridir.
    Finansal okuryazarlık
    Paranı nasıl kullanıyorsun.. 
3. Statünün değil, Zenginleşmenin peşinde koş..
    Zengin olmadan zengin gibi gözükmemek...
    iPhone almak yerine, Apple'a yatırım yap
    Statü mücadelesinden lüksten vazgeç, gerçeğe koş..
4. Öğrenmeye devam, öğrenmeyi öğren
    Her şeyin temeli öğrenmek
    İnsanın bilgisi arttıkça, hayattan tat alma ihtimali artıyor.
5. Başkalarına nasıl elde edeceklerini bilmedikleri şeyi verin ve bundan para kazanmanın yolunu bulun...
    Nasıl elde edildiğini bilirlerse onlar sana tehdit olur
    İhtiyaçları karşıla...
    haddini aş..
