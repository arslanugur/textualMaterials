$1M per year isnt a lot of money

    $1.75t notes in circulation in 2020
    FED decided to print another 2.3t$
    "Value comes from scarcity"
    this devaluation of currency is called inflation
    $1m per year in 2020 is roughly the equivalent of 250k$ just 30 years ago, not just because of inflation, but also the buying power
    real-estate is a great barometer of this..

If you wanna get rich, own sth that increases in value over time..

  Retirement is not a gift for working hard for your entire life...

                            The number is 2X what your lifestyle costs, generated by your investments.
  
  If your lifestyle costs = $60,000 per year
                            food, gas, clothes, subscriptions etc.
                            $5,000 per month on average

# Investing Mistakes
    Decision Making, Ratio of Success
- Being emotional about money is a mistake
    Deal-flow - number of oportunities and investments
        the more deals you make the better your decision-making mechanism
        Having a strong deal-flow is important for investors or businesses looking to grow and make profitable investments or partnerships. 
        By having a large pool of potential opportunities to choose from, they can be more selective and choose the best options that align with their goals and values. 
        It can also give them an advantage in negotiating favorable terms or finding unique opportunities that may not be widely known.

        Deal-flow can come from a variety of sources, such as personal networks, industry events, online platforms, and other sources. 
        It's important to have a diverse and reliable set of sources to ensure a steady flow of high-quality opportunities.

- Trying to time the market is a mistake
    Dont buy bad assets...
    Time in the market beats timing the market.
    Think in decades instead of months...

- Short term bets, trades and short term thinking is a mistake
    Think longer about your investments..
    Think in decades instead of months...
    No Casino, No Gambling..
    
- Being cash poor is a mistake
    --> Difference between making money and building wealth
        the poor buy an assets with the hopes that they will be able to sell it at a later date for more than they paid for and thus make a profit.
        the wealthy buy assets with the intention of never selling them.
            buy income generating assets... a continuous accumulation..

- Putting all your eggs into one basket
    90% of your investments should be split based on your expertise, the rest is play money.
    75% business, 20% real-estate, 5% stocks..
    90% of your investments should go towards what you know.

- Spreading yourself too thin is a mistake
    $10k to invest
        - WRONG 
        100 different stocks
        $100 in each one by expecting major moves or doubles in value in a short period....
        - RIGHT
        10 stocks you pick.. and long run..
        $1000 each
        Extra $1000 and your portfolio would go up by %10
        the more you know, the less you need to diversify...
        
        80% of our stock portfolio is just the S&P500
        the remaining 20% is just there for quick cash liquidity..
        
- Investing in sth just because X invested in it is a mistake
    you do not have the same agility of play as they do
    if you're walking in the footsteps of someone else, know that they already got the reward before you get there
    for most of people, money is emotional...

- Investing based on what's on the news, newsletters or forums, channels is a mistake.

- Investing in things they don't understand is a mistake
    distractions and shiny objects..
    if you cannot explain it end to end to someone else, you shouldn't invest..
    
- Failing to rebalance a personal portfolio is a mistake
    rebalance your investments...
    $100k distribution
        70% real estate             70k$ ---> 100k$
        25% stocks                  25k$ ---> 50k$
        5% cryto or blue chip art   5k$ ---> 50k$ 10Xd
                                             200k$
                                             the total value of your portfolio has now jumped from 100k$ to 200k$
    Right rebalancing = 200k$ distribution
    $140k$ real-estate
    $50k stocks
    $10k crypto or art
                                             
- Panic Selling is a mistake
    is the promise the same?
    is the company still around?
    is it still profitable?
    
- Not taking out profits is a mistake
    nobody ever went broke taking profits..

- constantly checking your investments is a mistake
    time-wasting and anxiety-inducing
    
- Going YOLO is a mistake
- Thinking "this time is different" is a mistake
    once you get burnt, dont put your hand back in the fire
    
- money takes over your life
    dont let it..
    is it worth?

# 15 things you buy that make you richer
- Useful Education
  "first you learn, then remove the L."
  "Skill should have value"

- Online Courses
  courses.alux.com
  
- Time-saving purchases
  If you have some money to invest, move to a new rental place where your rent is higher, but you're closer to work
  Transportation as a problem
  If you move 30 min closer to work, you can justify paying up to 50% more in rent
  30 min on your way in +30 min on your way back, that's an hour per day.
  5 hours per week = 20h per month = 240h per year
  8 hours per day --> 240/8=30 extra workdays

- Your Environment
  Upgrade your environment, because your environment upgrades you..

- Country Club memberships

  Accountants are the magicians of the financial world

- Great Birthday gifts

- Another Apartment

- Equity in other people's business

- Being rich /versus/ being wealthy
  Rich is when you earn a lot of money by working
  Wealthy is when you earn money in your sleep
    when if you stopped working today, your fortune would still go up tomorrow
  You need to know this difference...

# Naval Ravikant Principles
1. ZamanÄ±nÄ± baÅŸkalarÄ±na satarak zengin olamazsÄ±n
    EmeÄŸin karÅŸÄ±lÄ±ÄŸÄ±nda para kazanÄ±yorsun.. Doktor vesairesin yine olmaz..
    Zenginlik deÄŸil, Refah olmalÄ±, servet sahibi olmalÄ±sÄ±n.. Bu seni Ã¶zgÃ¼r yapar.
    Ã‡alÄ±ÅŸmasan bile iÅŸleyecek bir sistem kurmalÄ±sÄ±n.
    Restaurant sahibi olmak Ã¶nemli deÄŸil, o restaurant sensiz de iÅŸleyebilir mi bunun yolunu yap
    Siz Ã§alÄ±ÅŸmazken de size para kazanduracak sistem/iÅŸ kur.
        Bir iÅŸ kur, bu iÅŸin de pek Ã§ok faktÃ¶rÃ¼nÃ¼ baÅŸkalarÄ±na yaptÄ±r. BaÅŸkalarÄ±nÄ±n emeÄŸiyle bir kaldÄ±raÃ§tan yararlanacaksÄ±n. YatÄ±rÄ±m yap..
2. Para kazanmak yapÄ±lan bir iÅŸ deÄŸil, Ã¶ÄŸrenilen bir beceridir.
    Finansal okuryazarlÄ±k
    ParanÄ± nasÄ±l kullanÄ±yorsun.. 
3. StatÃ¼nÃ¼n deÄŸil, ZenginleÅŸmenin peÅŸinde koÅŸ..
    Zengin olmadan zengin gibi gÃ¶zÃ¼kmemek...
    iPhone almak yerine, Apple'a yatÄ±rÄ±m yap
    StatÃ¼ mÃ¼cadelesinden lÃ¼ksten vazgeÃ§, gerÃ§eÄŸe koÅŸ..
4. Ã–ÄŸrenmeye devam, Ã¶ÄŸrenmeyi Ã¶ÄŸren
    Her ÅŸeyin temeli Ã¶ÄŸrenmek
    Ä°nsanÄ±n bilgisi arttÄ±kÃ§a, hayattan tat alma ihtimali artÄ±yor.
5. BaÅŸkalarÄ±na nasÄ±l elde edeceklerini bilmedikleri ÅŸeyi verin ve bundan para kazanmanÄ±n yolunu bulun...
    NasÄ±l elde edildiÄŸini bilirlerse onlar sana tehdit olur
    Ä°htiyaÃ§larÄ± karÅŸÄ±la...
    haddini aÅŸ..
