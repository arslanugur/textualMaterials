  Neye inanıyorsam hayatımda da onu gerçekleştirmiş oluyorum.

# Financial Arbitrage... 
Not all money is the same
People in europe think in euro
People in russia think in ruble
People in us think in dollar
  They are accustomed to uni-directional thinking, but it is wrong...

Pros:
  $1M can buy a house in LA, but also $1M can buy a hotel in somewhere else...

# Money's Value
  How to safeguard your money?
The problem with money is that it doesnt hold its value in time unless invested.
Dont keep in the bank, keep investing
Cash is not a king anymore, but a king in negotiations

Investment will grow in time and alleviate the potential pain in your life

Rich looks at cash the way we look at ice-cubes in a warm room.
Don't hold the cash in your hand for too long cause u might see it melt away

$1M per year isnt a lot of money
    money is getting devalued every single year
    $1.75t notes in circulation in 2020
    FED decided to print another 2.3t$
    "Value comes from scarcity"
    this devaluation of currency is called inflation
    $1m per year in 2020 is roughly the equivalent of 250k$ just 30 years ago, not just because of inflation, but also the buying power
    real-estate is a great barometer of this..

If you wanna get rich, own sth that increases in value over time..

# Any healthy person can at any point choose to trade their time for money
# Two Barbers' Margin 
  Two barbers with the same level of expertise and the same prices and the same specialization
    first barber  ---> works 4h/day --> serves 3 clients
    second barber ---> works 12h/day --> serves 9 clients
    3 years = 9 years ---> massive margin between them
      second barber has earned in only 3 years as much money as first barber will earn in a total of nine years
      
  It didnt cost any more money to create this gap
  "Any fool can make money if they have enough of it. The real value lies in being able to make money when you have none"
    
  quality, differentiation and competition
  the more time you're willing to trade the more money you'll have

# Retirement trap
  Retirement is not a gift for working hard for your entire life...
  Retirement is not an age, it's a number
                            So, You can hit your number at 30, 40, 50 ...
                            The number is 2X what your lifestyle costs, generated by your investments.
  
  If your lifestyle costs = $60,000 per year
                            food, gas, clothes, subscriptions etc.
                            $5,000 per month on average
              your number = $10,000 per month from passive income
