Always tell the truth in the form of joke
true love is a big deal
you have to be odd to be number one
depend on your walking stick, not on other people
a polite devil is more agreeable than a rude saint
he will come to us like the rain
do unto others as you would have them do unto you
night is the mother of advice
he who has not obeyed, cannot command.
a coward has no scar
when the mouse laughs at the cat, there is a hole nearby
vision without execution is just hallucination
when money speaks, no one checks the grammar.
a trader looks for consistency, a gambler looks for a quick profit
		   tutarlılık
		   kıvam
		   uyum
money is a good servant but a bad master
seek responsibility, not happiness
an excess of courtesy is discourtesy - aşırı nezaket nezaketsizliktir
nobody who ever gave their best regretted it - Elinden gelenin en iyisini yapan hiç kimse bundan pişman olmadı
you are entirely up to you


IKIGAI

acting virtuously
learn to fill the mind
rest to empty the mind
create to express the mind
sip - slowly drinking
wrong is wrong even when it helps you

success: high commitment, low expectations
motivation is the result of action


	
# Seven Universal Laws of Energy
	- you attract what vşbrates at your same energetic frequency
	- energy is expressed in parallel through our different planes of existence. 
		mind = body = emotions
	- energy as a whole can change from any of its aspects:
		physical, mental, emotional
	- energy doesn't go anywhere, it's only transmuted
	- energy moves in patterns creating predictability:
		fibonacci, seasons, aging
	- energy responds to the law of cause and effect.
	  what goes out will come back, unless it's transmuted
	- once energy is transmuted, it cannot replicate its old state
