In the last few years, I have had the opportunity to deal with many branches of programming, 
and to try and work by myself on many data structures and algorithms with various programming languages, 
you can see the things I work on my GitHub page and LinkedIn profile. 
I would like to improve myself in a programming job, which I see as a skill. With such an opportunity, 
I am sure that I will realize this and that I will be able to experience the theoretical knowledge I have acquired in practice. 
I think that producing a good product and developing business for both the company and the user with a team will make me feel happy and excited. 
Thank you for your consideration.
Regards

Dear Mr. Amatte,

Please accept this letter expressing my interest in the lead oral surgery assistant position. 
I am a highly motivated and progress-focused oral surgery assistant with a long-standing background in this industry. 
With over six years of experience and a track record of initiative and dependability. 
I have devised strategic initiatives that will prove valuable to Belevue Oral, Facial & Implant Surgery

Throughout the course of my career, I have perfected my infection control and chairside assisting abilities. 
I am a capable and consistent problem-solver skilled at prioritizing and managing projects with proficiency. 
I also greeted over 30 patients upon arrival at the office and helped prepare for surgeries each month.

In my previous role, I contributed collaboration, critical thinking, and treatment room prep toward team efforts and business improvements. 
I am progressive-minded and in tune with new developments in my field. 
I have proven to be effective and collaborative with strong communication talents. 
I enjoy collective brainstorming sessions in which I coordinate activities to achieve a common goal for the surgery.

Please take a moment to review my attached resume, certifications and credentials. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to speak with you regarding my candidacy

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely.
Jane Rodgors
