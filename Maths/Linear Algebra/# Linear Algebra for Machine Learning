# Norms, Refreshment from Trigonometry
  the norm of a vector, denoted as |v| or ||v||, represents the vector's magnitude (length)
  for a vector v € Rⁿ, its norm is calculated a 
  || ->||
  || v || = √v²_1 + v²_2 + ... + v²_n
  ------> L_2 Norm
    it is used in the retrogression for regularization technique
    to measure the distance or the relationship or the similarity between two different entities

  norms provide a way to measure the size or length of vectors in vector spaces
